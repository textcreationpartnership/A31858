            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Here preſent you with ſome Sermons of my dear Brother deceaſed, your late (if <hi>I</hi> may be allowed to ſay it) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and faithfull Paſtour; in tranſcribing them for the Preſs I have not preſumed to make any alteration, or to correct ſo much as the plain errata's of the original Copy, except onely ſome few, and thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:60424:3"/>ſuch as any Reader almoſt would have obſerved, and may well be ſuppoſed to have been occaſioned onely through his haſte in writing; and if after all there happen to be any ſuch ſtill remaining in the print, I hope you will blame neither him nor me, ſince I pretend not to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any diſcourſes deſigned or fitted by him for the Preſs, but onely thoſe very Sermons which you your ſelves heard, juſt as I found them in his notes.</p>
            <p>If it be asked why theſe rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? I anſwer, theſe were the Sermons which I found had been preached by him in the moſt publick places; to which however becauſe they would not alone have made a juſt volume, I thought it neceſſary to add two or three more; and I doubt not but you will find them all plain and uſefull, and every way fitted to doe good: And if it be asked why no more? I think it will be time enough to
<pb facs="tcp:60424:3"/>anſwer that queſtion, when I ſhall have ſeen what acceptance theſe now publiſhed meet with in the world.</p>
            <p>It was ſome time before I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my ſelf to comply with your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in publiſhing theſe Sermons, becauſe I have ſometimes heard my Brother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs an unwillingneſs that any thing of his ſhould be printed after his death; but when I had once reſolved to print them, it took me no time to conſider, it was not left to my choice to whom I ſhould preſent them, ſeeing you had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted title to them; and all the world would have blamed me, if I had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this occaſion of acknowledging with all thankfulneſs your extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his perſon whilſt alive, and to his memory after his deceaſe; one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance of which I muſt by no means omit, I mean your generous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his Widow; a kindneſs which as I
<pb facs="tcp:60424:4"/>am confident he never expected, even from you, from whom he might have expected any thing that was kind; ſo I dare ſay if he could have foreſeen it, would have pleaſed him more than any, nay, than all the other kindneſſes he ever received from you.</p>
            <p>In the words therefore of <hi>Naomi</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Boaz, Bleſſed be ye of the Lord, who have not left off your kindneſs to the living and to the dead.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WHICH words give us a ſhort account of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's life here on earth; it was ſpent in doing good: They alſo teach us after what manner we his diſciples ought to live in this World, namely that we ſhould omit no fair opportunity of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60424:6"/>doing good according to our ſeveral abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and capacities. I ſhall ſpeak to them</p>
            <p n="1">I. As referring to our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and deſcribing his manner of life to us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall conſider them as preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to us our duty in imitation of his moſt glorious example <hi>who went about doing good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(I.) As referring to our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and deſcribing his manner of life to us. Now theſe words, <hi>he went about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good,</hi> eſpecially ſignifie theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this was the chief buſineſs and employment of his life, to <hi>doe good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That where he did not readily find, he went about to ſeek objects of pity and compaſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This he conſtantly perſevered in, notwithſtanding the foul ingratitude and malicious oppoſition his good works met with in the World.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60424:6"/>
            <p n="1">1. This was the chief buſineſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of his life to <hi>doe good.</hi> To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to you the ſeveral inſtances of it, were to give you an hiſtory and account of his whole life, the four Goſpels being nothing elſe but the authentick records of thoſe good works <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> did, containing his excellent inſtructions, his free reproofs, the wiſe methods he uſed for the bettering and reforming men's minds, together with thoſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kindneſſes he ſhewed to their bodies and outward eſtates with a generoſity and charity not to be parallell'd by any thing but the divine goodneſs it ſelf. I ſhall not therefore deſcend to particulars, but onely take notice, 1. That <hi>doing good</hi> was his ordinary daily employment. 2. That to the ſame end tended all his extraordinary miraculous works: and 3. That this was alſo the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Religion. From all which it will eaſily appear, that he made <hi>doing good</hi> the chief buſineſs of his whole life.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Doing good was his ordinary dai-employment. He did not onely by the by, and on great occaſions exerciſe his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60424:7"/>charity and compaſſion, but it was as it were his onely profeſſion, his meat and drink, his buſineſs and recreation too; ſo that he denied himſelf the conveniences of this life that he might attend this work. How was he throng'd after and preſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the miſerable and unfortunate, the diſeaſed and poſſeſſed in all places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came, and can you tell of any one perſon whom he ever ſent from his preſence diſſatisfied? It was but ſaying <hi>Lord have mercy upon me,</hi> and the poor humble beggar's wants (of what kind ſoever) were ſtrait ſupplied.</p>
            <p>And by theſe acts of love and kindneſs he did engage men to hearken to his wiſe counſels, and obey his gratious commands, for he had a farther deſign in all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion which he ſhewed towards mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and outward eſtates, <hi>viz.</hi> to heal their bodies and their minds both together; to inſtill and inſinuate good inſtruction, and to promote men's <hi>eternal</hi> welfare, by contributing ſo much to their eaſe and happineſs in this <hi>preſent</hi> life.</p>
            <p>All this good he did with the greateſt readineſs and joy; it was his greateſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60424:7"/>pleaſure to ſpread his healing wings over every place, continually to diſpenſe his benign influences and favours, and to make every one, who had the happineſs to converſe with him, ſenſible of his good-will to Mankind. Nor from this would he ever reſt, not ſo much as on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> though he was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Tranſgreſſour for it. He conſulted the good of other men above his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and would cure the ſick on that day even before thoſe who thought it a great piece of prophaneneſs and wickedneſs ſo to doe. He wanted ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſooner than will to ſhew kindneſs; and nothing grieved him ſo much as that men by their own malice and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould obſtruct and defeat his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſigns toward them, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſe to be made happy by him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This was not onely his ordinary daily employment, but for this end did he always exerciſe his extraordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, to doe benefits. All his Miracles were mercies to men, ſo that his wonderfull works proved him to be ſent from God, not more by that infinite power that was ſeen in them, than by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60424:8"/>that ſurpaſſing goodneſs they demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the World.</p>
            <p>He never employed his omnipotence out of levity or oſtentation, but onely as the neceſſities and wants of Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it. His miraculous works were not ſuch as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſometimes deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and expected from him, ſuch onely as would ſtrike their ſenſes and fancy with admiration and aſtoniſhment, as the making prodigious and amazing ſhews and repreſentations in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, or in the Air; but they were all expreſſions of a moſt immenſe benignity and charity to Mankind, ſuch as healing the ſick of all manner of diſeaſes, making the lame to walk, and the blind to ſee, and the deaf to hear, cleanſing the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, feeding the hungry, raiſing the dead, and caſting evil ſpirits out of thoſe that were miſerably poſſeſſed with them, and cruelly tormented by them.</p>
            <p>In ſuch good offices, ſo uſefull and profitable to Men, did he all along exert and manifeſt that divine power which God had anointed him with, thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating himſelf to be the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60424:8"/>perſon that ever appeared in our fleſh, not onely by doing the ſtrangeſt and moſt miraculous works, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by doing the moſt good in the World.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) To <hi>doe good</hi> was the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Religion. He affected not any preciſe ſingularities, or unuſual ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of life. Of all the time he was here on earth, he ſpent but forty days in the Wilderneſs in cloſe ſolitude and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the reſt of his time he converſed freely and openly, that thereby he might have opportunity of obliging and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting all ſorts of Men. He neglected not indeed any duty of piety towards God, but then his love to God ſhone forth moſt reſplendently in his inceſſant care of, and charity to his Creatures. He knew he could not pleaſe or glorify his Father better, than by bearing much fruit, or, which is all one, doing much good in the World.</p>
            <p>His Religion was active and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: it conſiſted not in notions or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, or external abſtinences and ſtrictneſſes, by which the ſeveral Sects
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60424:9"/>amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were diſtinguiſhed one from another; but the principal thing he was moſt remarkable for in his way of living was a moſt ſincere readineſs to doe all manner of good to all that came to him. He pretended not to any ſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick enthuſiaſtical raptures, or inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unaccountable tranſports of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or wonderfull mortification; others might pray oftner and longer, faſt more than He or his Diſciples did, (as we know was objected againſt him by St. <hi>John</hi>'s diſciples;) but no Saint, no Prophet, no Man ever before him ſo ſerved God in his generation, or was either able or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew ſuch conſiderable kindneſſes to the World as our bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did.</p>
            <p>And in this chiefly did his holineſs and godlineſs appear above the rate and pitch of other mens, in that he was ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mercifull and charitable: He made not ſuch a pompous outward ſhew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as ſome of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, but his actions truly beſpoke him what he was, a perſon infinitely full of goodneſs, that could not be at eaſe without conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual venting it ſelf; nor yet by all the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60424:9"/>wants, infirmities, neceſſities, either of mens minds or bodies could ever be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.</p>
            <p>Thus he made doing good the chief buſineſs and employment of his whole life, which is the firſt thing ſignified by theſe words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>he went about doing good</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies farther, that where he did not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily meet with, he induſtriouſly ſought out objects of pity and compaſſion. His goodneſs did often prevent mens deſires, always ſurpaſs them, doing for them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all their requeſts or hopes. <hi>He came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He deſcended from the boſome of his Father, and eclipſed the glory of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty with a veil of fleſh, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved amongſt us, that he might redeem us from the greateſt evils and miſeries, even whilſt we were enemies to him, and deſired no more than we deſerved his love and favour. And whilſt he was here upon earth, he was not onely eaſie of acceſs, he did not onely courteouſly receive all that addreſſed themſelves to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60424:10"/>him, he not onely freely invited and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged all men to repair to him for ſuccour and relief; but alſo did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain himſelf to travel up and down the Countrey on purpoſe to give opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all that ſtood in need of him, to partake of his healing vertue and power. Thoſe whom his Diſciples checked for their rude and troubleſome importunity, he lovingly entertained, and never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed without a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>This mightily enhanced the value of every kindneſs he beſtowed, the frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his doing it doubled the benefit. We ſpoil a good turn when it is extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from us. It loſeth all its grace and acceptableneſs when it is done <hi>grudgingly,</hi> and <hi>as of neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay our Saviour denied not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe familiarly with <hi>Publicans</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Sinners;</hi> he endeared himſelf to them by ſignal condeſcenſions, though this alſo proved matter of reproach and infamy to him: as if he countenanced thoſe vices he attempted to cure, or it were any diſgrace to a Phyſitian to viſit his patients. He refuſed not the civil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60424:10"/>of a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> though his ſworn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and would go to the houſes, and eat at the table of thoſe who ſought his ruine: and whatever ill deſign they might have in inviting him, yet he always improved the occaſion for the doing them ſome conſiderable good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And Laſtly. He conſtantly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in this notwithſtanding the foul ingratitude and malitious oppoſition his good works met with in the World. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any one meet with greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, or more unworthy returns than the Son of God, when all his acts of beneficence, all the good offices he had done amongſt them were ſo far from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, that they rather tended to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and provoke that untoward gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and the more kindneſs he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed toward them, the greater haſt they made to betray and deſtroy him. This great Patron and Benefactour, this generous friend and lover of Mankind, was mortally hated and cruelly perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as if he had been a publick enemy, and had done or deſigned ſome notorious miſchief. They continually laid traps to enſnare him, loaded him with malitious
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60424:11"/>ſlanders, greedily watched for an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to animate the multitude againſt him, took up ſtones to throw at him, as a reward of his gratious attemt to make them wiſe and happy; put bad conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and made ſiniſter interpretations of all the good he did, as if he deſigned to careſs the people, and by ſuch arts to gratify his ambition, and make himſelf popular. So that this great and gallant perſon was looked upon as a dangerous man, and the more good he did, the more he was feared and ſuſpected: yet all this and a thouſand times worſe uſage could not diſſwade him from perſiſting in doing good to them. He was ready to repay all theſe injuries with courteſies, even his bittereſt enemies were partakers of his kindneſs, and he ſtill continued to entreat them to accept of life from him, and with tears of true compaſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed their infidelity and wilfull folly. Nay at laſt when they laid violent hands upon him, and put him to the ſhamefull death of the Croſs, yet then did he pray to his Father to forgive them; and which is ſtill moſt wonderfull, and is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfection of charity, he willingly laid down his life for them who ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60424:11"/>cruelly and treacherouſly took it from him. Thus our Lord <hi>went about doing good;</hi> Let us who are his diſciples and followers go now and doe likewiſe: which brings me to the ſecond thing I was to conſider in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Our duty in imitation of his moſt glorious example, <hi>who went about doing good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But we, you'll ſay, are not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, we have not ability or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing good in that ample manner, in that meaſure and degree our Lord did. We cannot by any means, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever willing to it or diligent in it) come up to the perfection of this noble and heroical example. Were ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous powers communicated to us as were to our Saviour, ſo that by a word ſpeaking we could heal all manner of ſickneſs, and reſtore ſight to the blind, and feet to the lame; could we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ignorant, reprove the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ane, admoniſh the erring with ſo much eaſe, advantage and authority as our bleſſed Lord did, we ſhould then perhaps be very free and liberal in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60424:12"/>thoſe great favours and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings Heaven had ſo ſignally beſtowed upon us, for the good and benefit of others; but alas! as things now ſtand with us, we have neither power, nor skill, nor means to doe good at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that illuſtrious manner our Saviour did.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which all I ſhall at preſent reply is, that though we cannot after that ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious manner be beneficial to mankind as our Saviour was, yet there are very many things which we are able to doe for the good of others, which our bleſſed Saviour could not doe by reaſon of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and low eſtate in this World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expence of a miracle.</p>
            <p>Few of us but as to our outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in this life are in a far more plentifull condition than the Son of God himſelf was, whilſt here on earth: and it is in our power by ordinary ways to relieve and ſuccour, oblige and benefit many, ſo as our Lord could not doe, without employing his divine power to furniſh himſelf with means for it.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60424:12"/>
            <p>Be pleaſed therefore to take notice that it is not doing good juſt in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or after that ſame wonderfull manner, that this example obligeth us unto, but onely to a like willingneſs and readineſs to doe good upon all fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as far as our power and activity reacheth; it obligeth us all in our ſeveral ſtations, according to thoſe opportunities God hath afforded us, and thoſe abilities he hath endued us with, and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of life his providence hath placed us in, to endeavour, as much as in us lieth, the welfare and proſperity, eaſe and happineſs of all men; ſo that others may bleſs the divine goodneſs for us, the ſtate of their bodies or minds being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by our imparting to them what God hath more abundantly beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>Contrary to which is a narrow, ſelfiſh, ſtingy ſpirit, when we are concerned for none but our ſelves, and regard not how it fares with other men, ſo it be but well with us; when we follow our own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and with great pleaſure enjoy the accommodations of our own ſtate; when
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60424:13"/>we think our own happineſs the greater becauſe we have it alone to our ſelves, and no other partakes of it: which of all other things is the moſt directly oppoſite to that benign and compaſſionate temper, which our Saviour came into the World by his doctrine and example to implant in men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not undertake to ſet before you the ſeveral inſtances of doing good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſince they are ſo various and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and our duty varies according to our circumſtances and opportunities, which are very different; and every one may eaſily find them out by conſidering what good he would have other Men doe for him. What he ſhould reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or would take kindly from thoſe he converſeth with, or is any ways related unto, all that he is in like caſes to be willing to doe for another; ſo that this doing good is a work of large compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive extent and univerſal influence; it reacheth to the ſouls and bodies of men, and takes in all thoſe ways and means whereby we may promote the temporal, ſpiritual or eternal advantage of others. And to ſo happy and noble
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60424:13"/>an employment one would think there ſhould be no need of perſuaſion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I humbly beg your patience whilſt I put you in mind of ſome of thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and conſiderations which ſeem moſt proper and effectual to engage men to the imitation of this bleſſed example, to doe all the good they can in the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This of all other employments is moſt agreeable to our natures. By do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good we gratify and comply with the beſt and nobleſt of our natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and appetites. The very ſame ſenſe which informs us of our own wants, and doth powerfully move and inſtigate us to provide for their relief, doth alſo reſent the diſtreſſes of another, and vehemently provoke and urge us to yield him all neceſſary ſuccour. This is true in all men, but moſt apparent in the beſt natures, that at beholding the miſeries and calamities of other men, they find ſuch yernings of their bowels, and ſuch ſenſible commotions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions raiſed in their own breaſts, as they can by no means ſatisfy, but by reaching forth their helping-hand: and to deny
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60424:14"/>our aſſiſtance according as our ability permits us, is a violence to our very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inſtincts and propenſions, as well as contrary to our religious obligations: Our very fleſh which in many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances tempts us to ſin, yet in this caſe prompts us to our duty.</p>
            <p>This is a gratious proviſion God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath made in favour of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous and calamitous; that ſince his providence, for great reaſons, is pleaſed to permit ſuch inequalities in mens for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and outward conditions, the ſtate of ſome in this life being ſo extremely wretched and deplorable, if compared with others; leſt the ſick and blind, and naked and poor ſhould ſeem to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or wholly diſregarded by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; he hath therefore implanted in men a quick and tender ſenſe of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, which ſhould always ſolicit and plead their cauſe, ſtand their friend, and not onely diſpoſe us, but e'en force us for our own quiet and ſatisfaction, though with ſome inconvenience to our ſelves, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ſuccour the afflicted and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, according to our ſeveral capacities and opportunities. And this ſympathy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60424:14"/>doth as truly belong to humane nature, as love, deſire, hope, fear, or any other affection of our minds; and it is as eaſie a matter to deveſt our ſelves of any other paſſion as of this of pity; and he who, like the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Parable of the wounded man, is void of all compaſſion, is degenerated not ſo much into the likeneſs of a brute beaſt, as of the hardeſt rock or marble. Thus to doe good is according to the very make and frame of our beings and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it follows that it muſt be the moſt pleaſant and delightfull em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment we can chooſe for our ſelves. Whatever is according to our nature, muſt for that reaſon be pleaſant: for all actual pleaſure conſiſts in the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſatisfaction of our natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and appetites. Since therefore the very conſtitution and temper of our nature ſway and prompt us to the exerciſe of charity and beneficence, the ſatisfying ſuch inclinations by doing good muſt be as truly gratefull to us, as any other thing or action whatever that miniſtreth to our pleaſure; and it cannot be more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60424:15"/>delightfull to receive kindneſſes than it is to beſtow them. A ſeaſonable unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted relief doth not affect him that ſtands in great need of it with more ſenſible contentment, than the opportunity of doing it doth rejoice a good man's heart. Nay it may be doubted on which hand lies the greateſt obligation; whether he who receives is more obliged to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for the good turn he hath done him, or the giver be more obliged to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver for the occaſion of exerciſing his goodneſs. When we receive great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes it puts us to the bluſh: we are aſhamed to be ſo highly obliged; but the joy of doing them is pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed: and this our Saviour hath told us, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.35. <hi>It is more bleſſed to give than to receive;</hi> and ſome good men have ventured to call it the greateſt ſenſuality, a piece of Epicuriſm, and have magnified the exceeding indulgence of God, who hath annexed future rewards to that which is ſo amply its own recompence.</p>
            <p>Theſe two advantages this pleaſure of doing good hath above all other pleaſures whatever.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60424:15"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) That this ſatisfaction doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt accompany the act of doing good, but it is permanent and laſting, endures as long as our lives. The very remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſuch charitable deeds by which we have been really helpfull and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to others, our after-reflexion upon the good we have done in the world doth wonderfully refreſh our ſouls with a mighty joy and peace, quite contrary to all other worldly and corporeal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. There are indeed ſome vices which promiſe a great deal of pleaſure in the commiſſion of them, but then at beſt it is but ſhort-lived and tranſient, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flaſh preſently extinguiſht. It pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in the very enjoyment, <hi>like the crackling of thorns under a pot,</hi> as the Wiſe-man elegantly expreſſes it; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently expires in a ſhort blaze and noiſe, but hath very little heat or warmth in it. All outward bodily pleaſures are of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fugitive volatile nature, there's no fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and if we endeavour to make up this defect by a frequent repetition and conſtant ſucceſſion of them, they then ſoon become nauſeous; men are cloyed and tired with them. Nor is this yet
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60424:16"/>all; theſe ſenſual pleaſures do not onely ſuddenly paſs away, but alſo leave a ſting behind them, they wound our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, the thoughts of them are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to us; guilt and a bitter repentance are the attendants of ſuch indulging our ſelves, ſadneſs and melancholy comes in the place of all ſuch exorbitant mirth and jollity. Theſe are the conſtant abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all outward unlawfull pleaſures. Whereas that which ſprings from a mind ſatisfied and well pleaſed with its own actions, doth for ever affect our hearts with a delicious reliſh; continually mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters comfort and delight to us; is a never-failing fountain of joy, ſuch as is ſolid and ſubſtantial; fills our minds with good hopes and chearfull thoughts; and is the onely certain ground of true peace and contentment.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This pleaſure and joy that attends doing good doth herein exceed all fleſhly delights, that it is then at the higheſt when we ſtand in moſt need of it: In a time of affliction, old age, or at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death, the remembrance of our good deeds will ſtrangely cheer and ſupport our ſpirits under all the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60424:16"/>and troubles we may meet with in this ſtate. By doing good we lay up a treaſure of comfort, a ſtock of joy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an evil day, which no outward thing can rob us of. But now it is not thus with bodily pleaſures; they cannot help us in a time of need, they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miſerably flat and inſipid; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cannot any longer taſte or reliſh them: nothing remains but a guilty ſenſe, which in ſuch time of diſtreſs is more fierce and raging, eſpecially at the hour of death.</p>
            <p>Yet even then, when all our former inordinate pleaſures ſhall prove matter of anguiſh and torment to us, when all the flowers of worldly glory ſhall be withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when all earthly beauty which now doth ſo tempt and bewitch us, ſhall be darkned and eclipſed, when this world and the faſhion of it is vaniſhed and gone, when the pangs of death are juſt taking hold of us, and we are ready to ſtep into another world, what a ſeaſonable and comfortable refreſhment then will it be to look back upon a well-ſpent life? to conſider with our ſelves how faithfully we have improved thoſe talents God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60424:17"/>hath intruſted us with; how well we have husbanded our time, eſtates, parts, reputation, learning, authority, for the glory of God and the good of other men. The time will ſurely ſhortly come where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall vaſtly more rejoice in that little you have laid out or expended for the benefit of others, than in all that which by ſo long toil and drudgery in the world you ſhall have ſaved and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. They are not your great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, lands or eſtates, nor your dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and titles of honour, nor your emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places and truſts, nor any external advantages you have purchaſed or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that at ſuch a time will yield you any true peace or comfortable hope. What uſe you have made of them, and what good you have done with them, is that which your conſcience will then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after, and accordingly pronounce its ſentence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To doe good is the moſt divine and God-like thing. By it we do moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially become like unto God, who <hi>is good,</hi> and <hi>who doth good;</hi> and not onely like him, but we reſemble him in that which is his very nature and eſſence, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60424:17"/>which he eſteems his greateſt glory: for ſuch is his goodneſs, which doth as it were deify all his other attributes and perfections.</p>
            <p>There is no quality or diſpoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by which we can ſo near approach the divine Majeſty, as this of beneficence, and delight in doing good. As for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and power the evil Spirits partake of them in a greater degree than the beſt men, but a man hath nothing of God ſo much as to doe good. By contributing to the contentment of other men, and rendring them as happy as lieth in our power, we doe God's work, are in his place and room, perform his office in the world; we make up the ſeeming defects of his providence, and one man thereby becomes as it were a God to another. Hence this employment muſt needs be the higheſt accompliſhment and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our beings. It is the onely argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a brave and great ſoul to extend his care and thoughts for the good of all men; and not to doe ſo is a certain indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a little narrow ſpirit, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted within it ſelf and its own paltry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60424:18"/>
            <p n="4">4. This is the very end of all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and ſeveral advantages God hath vouchſafed to Men in this life, that by them they might become capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good in the World; this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe they are to be put to, for which they were deſigned by the authour and donour of them; and if they are not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſuch purpoſes, we are falſe to our truſt, and the ſtewardſhip commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and ſhall be one day ſeverely accountable to God for it. For the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and Sovereign Lord and diſpoſer of all things both in Heaven and Earth hath aſſigned to every man his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place and ſtation in this World, hath given him his part to act on this great theatre, hath furniſhed him with powers and abilities of mind and body fitted for ſeveral uſes, in the due and regular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and management of which, every one may in ſome meaſure be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſerviceable to others. This our Saviour illuſtrates by his excellent para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>Talents,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>There is no man but God hath put many excellent things into his poſſeſſion,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60424:18"/>to be uſed, improved and managed by him for the common good and intereſt: for men are made for ſociety and mutual fellowſhip. We are not born for our ſelves alone, but every other man hath ſome right and intereſt in us, and as no man can live happily in this World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help and aſſiſtance of others, ſo neither is any man exempted or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged from being in his place ſome way beneficial to others,</p>
            <p>It is with men in this World, as it is with the parts of the body natural. It is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s compariſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſiſts of divers members, which neither have the ſame dignity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor the ſame uſe and office, but every part hath its proper uſe and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby it becomes ſerviceable to the whole body, and if any one part fails or is ill affected, the whole ſuffers for it, and the meaneſt part is neceſſary for the good of the whole; ſo that <hi>the eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee, nor</hi> again <hi>the head to the feet, I have no no need of you.</hi> Thus hath God diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral gifts amongſt the ſons of men, or they by God's bleſſing upon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60424:19"/>acquire particular art, skill and experience, ſome in one thing, ſome in another, none in all; ſo that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that every man muſt want ſomething for the conveniency of his life, for which he muſt be obliged to others; upon which accompt it is moſt highly reaſonable that he alſo himſelf ſhould ſome way oblige and ſerve others.</p>
            <p>But beſides this there are many ſpecial favours and advantages which ſome men enjoy above others, which alſo are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the common good and benefit. It is plain that there is a very great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality amongſt men both as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal endowments of their minds and their external conditions in this life. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more <hi>talents</hi> are committed to ſome perſons than to others; but yet we great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtake when we think them given us merely for our own ſakes, to ſerve our own turns, and for the ſatisfaction of our own private appetites and deſires, without any reſpect to other men. No, at the beſt they are but depoſited with us in truſt, the more we enjoy of them the greater charge we have upon our hands, and the more plentifull returns
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60424:19"/>God doth juſtly expect from us; <hi>for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whomſoever much is given,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>of him ſhall be much required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ought eſpecially to be conſidered by all thoſe who by reaſon of the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their qualities and dignities, and by their ſuperiority above others, have vaſt authority over them, whoſe ſphere is large and influence great, who have many dependents who court their favour and whoſe intereſt it is to obſerve and pleaſe them: what infinite good may ſuch doe in the world, eſpecially by their example?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Doing good is the main and moſt ſubſtantial part of Chriſtian Religion, the moſt acceptable ſacrifice we can offer, or ſervice we can perform to God; and therefore do we ſo often find in Scripture all Religion ſummed up as it were in this one thing, it being the beſt expreſſion of our duty towards God, and either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally containing or naturally producing all our duty towards our neighbour, whence this is ſaid to be the fulfilling of the whole law. It is not enough that we give to every man what is due to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60424:20"/>him. His Religion is but very little and of a narrow compaſs, who is onely juſt, nay he that is rigidly ſo in all caſes hath no Religion at all: that I have wronged no man will be a poor plea or apology at the laſt day, for it is not for rapine or injury, for pillaging or couſening their neighbours, that men at the laſt day are formally impeached and finally condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but <hi>I was an hungry and ye gave me no meat, I was a ſtranger and ye took me not in;</hi> you neglected to doe that good which you had power and opportunity to doe.</p>
            <p>Some men are ſo taken up with their courſes of piety and devotion, that they have no time to doe much good; if they be but temperate and juſt, and come fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to Church, and conſtantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duties of God's worſhip, this they hope will carry them to Heaven though they are notoriouſly covetous and uncharitable, and hardly ever doe any good office for their neighbours or brethren. Some again there are who pretend to be of a more ſpiritual and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Religion, ſpend their time in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and talk much of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60424:20"/>with God, but look upon this way of ſerving God by doing good as a lower at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, an inferior diſpenſation ſuitable to children and novices in Religion, and think that they are excuſed from theſe mean duties; and yet reade over the life of the beſt man that ever lived, the founder of our Faith and Religion, and you cannot but confeſs what I have already ſhewn you, that the great thing he was moſt exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary and illuſtrious for, was his unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried readineſs to help and oblige all men, <hi>he went about doing good:</hi> and it is a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal raiſed on <hi>our Church,</hi> that we do not hold the neceſſity of good works in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſalvation, but truſt wholly to faith; for we hold and teach them to be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves can or doe, but then we ſay they are accepted by God onely for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And Laſtly. Nothing hath greater rewards annexed to it than doing good and that both in this life and that which is to come. I have time now but juſt to mention to you ſome few of thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and advantages, that do either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flow from it, or by God's gratious promiſe are annexed to it.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60424:21"/>
            <p>To doe good with what we enjoy is the moſt certain way to procure God's bleſſing upon all we have; it doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title us to his more eſpecial care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. <hi>Truſt in the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, and be doing good, ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed.</hi> The divine goodneſs cannot but be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pleaſed to ſee men ſo far as they are able imitating it ſelf, and following the example of God's benignity.</p>
            <p>For every good office we doe to other men we have ſome thing to plead with God Almighty to engage him to beſtow upon us what we want or deſire; not by way of merit or deſert, but God himſelf graciouſly becoming our debtour, takes what is done to others in ſuch caſes as done to himſelf, and by promiſe obliges himſelf to full retaliation.</p>
            <p>By this means we provide againſt an evil day that which will mightily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us under all the troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may happen to us in this life; our good works will attend us and ſtand by us at the hour of death, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60424:21"/>hinted to you, nay farther our good works will appear and plead for us before God's tribunal, and will procure for us for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, at the hands of our mercifull God, a glorious recompenſe at the reſurrection of the juſt; for at the laſt and final reckoning, when all mens actions ſhall be ſcanned and judged, the great King ſhall paſs his ſentence according to the good men have done or neglected to doe in this life.</p>
            <p>Nay every way ſo great is the reward of doing good, that even wicked men, who yet have been of bountifull tempers and have had generous ſpirits, ſhall fare the better in the other world for thoſe good acts of mercy and charity they have done here; and in this ſenſe it is ſaid (with which I end all) that <hi>Charity doth cover a multitude of ſins,</hi> and to <hi>cover ſins</hi> in the Scripture phraſe is to forgive them.</p>
            <p>Now of this ſaying there are ſeveral ſenſes given, which I cannot ſtand now to recite, but the words are true in theſe two ſenſes.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60424:22"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) If he that is thus truly charitable, and hath done a great deal of good in his generation be alſo endued with the other vertues and qualifications required in a Chriſtian, then though he may have a great many infirmities and miſcarriages to anſwer for, yet theſe failings ſhall be overlooked and buried in his good deeds, and then they mean the ſame with that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, with the mercifull God will ſhew himſelf mercifull,</hi> he will ſhew him all favour poſſible.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Or elſe ſecondly, if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe words, <hi>Charity ſhall cover a multitude of ſins,</hi> as ſpoken of a perſon, who though vitious in all other reſpects yet out of principles of common huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or natural goodneſs of temper, or greatneſs of Spirit, is very apt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe generous and great things for the good of the world; (which is a caſe that may ſometimes happen,) they mean this, that though Charity alone will not be ſufficient to make ſuch an one happy in the other world, becauſe he is otherwiſe incapable of it, yet it ſhall be conſidered ſo far as to leſſen his puniſhment. He
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60424:22"/>ſhall be in a leſs intolerable condition, (though that be ſad enough) than the cruel and uncharitable, or than they who have delighted in doing miſchief.</p>

            <p>THE Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which we are now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is undoubtedly the moſt ſolemn and venerable part of Chriſtian worſhip, a moſt excellent inſtrument of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60424:24"/>Religion, an inſtitution of our Saviour's of mighty uſe and advantage to us, if we duly partake thereof; and yet there is hardly any part of Religion ſo little or ſo ill underſtood by the generality of Chriſtians amongſt us, as this duty: which ſufficiently appears from that great number of thoſe who conſtantly join with the Church in all other publick offices of divine worſhip, and yet wholly neglect the receiving of this Sacrament; or at leaſt communicate ſo ſeldom, as if they looked upon themſelves at liberty to doe it, or not doe it, as they thought beſt. I ſpeak not now of the prophane contemners of God and Religion, who deſpiſe this as they do all the other duties of God's worſhip; but of thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the fear of God, and care of their ſouls, and yet live at eaſe in the groſs omiſſion of this duty.</p>
            <p>Now amongſt the many pleas or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes with which men ſatisfy themſelves in the neglect or diſuſe of this holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that which moſt generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, and perhaps with ſome honeſt and well-meaning perſons, is the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words of my <hi>Text, He that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60424:24"/>eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf.</hi> So dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the threatning and puniſhment here denounced againſt thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Sacrament unworthily, that men are apt to think it much the ſafer and wifer courſe, never to venture on a duty, the wrong performance of which is attended with ſo great miſchief. Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is ſo terrible a word, and to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as it is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord</hi>) is ſo heinous a crime, that it may ſeem the moſt prudent courſe for a man to keep himſelf at the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from all poſſibility of falling into it. Better never receive at all, than expoſe ones ſelf to ſo great hazard by receiving.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore it will not be thought altogether unprofitable to entertain you at this time with a diſcourſe on theſe words, wherein I ſhall endeavour to give you the full meaning of them, with the true and juſt inferences and conſequences that may be drawn from them. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which I ſhall ſhew you</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60424:25"/>
            <p n="1">I. What is meant here by <hi>damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. What by <hi>eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. How far this Text may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſcare and fright people from this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. What is the true conſequence from what is here affirmed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. What is meant here by eating and drinking <hi>damnation</hi> to a man's ſelf. The original word which is here tranſlated <hi>damnation</hi> truly ſignifies no more than <hi>judgment</hi> or <hi>puniſhment</hi> in general, of what kind ſoever it be, temporal or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. So that there is no neceſſity of tranſlating it here by the word <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nay there are two plain reaſons why it ought to be underſtood onely of <hi>temporal</hi> evils and chaſtiſements.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60424:25"/>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the judgments that were inflicted on the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of this holy Sacrament were onely <hi>temporal;</hi> verſe 30th. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the reaſon aſſigned of theſe judgments is, <hi>that they might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the other world,</hi> v. 32. <hi>But when we are judged</hi> (where the ſame Greek word is uſed which in my Text is tranſlated <hi>damnation) we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we might not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the world.</hi> That is, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted theſe evils on the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that being reformed by theſe ſtripes in this life, they might eſcape that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which was reſerved for the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent in another life; and therefore it could not be <hi>damnation,</hi> that is, eternal damnation that was either threatned or inflicted upon them for their unworthy receiving.</p>
            <p>The ſum of what the Apoſtle means ſeems to be this; that <q>By prophaning this holy Sacrament they would pluck
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60424:26"/>down ſome remarkable judgment upon their heads. Of this, ſaith he, you have notorious inſtances amongſt your ſelves in thoſe various and mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that have been ſo riſe in your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and this God doth to warn you, that you may be awakened to avoid greater and worſe judgments that are future and eternal.</q> Now this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was extraordinary and peculiar to that time; for there is no ſuch thing found amongſt us at this day, namely, that God doth ſuddenly ſmite all unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicants with ſome grievous diſeaſe or ſudden death. Nor indeed are men afraid of any ſuch thing, though it is very plain that this is the true meaning of the words of my <hi>Text,</hi> that by ſuch prophaneneſs they would bring down ſome remarkable <hi>temporal</hi> judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not inſiſt any longer upon this, but take the word damnation as we commonly underſtand it, and in that ſenſe, to eat and drink <hi>damnation</hi> to a man's ſelf, doth imply, that by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy participation of the Sacrament, we are ſo far from receiving any benefit
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60424:26"/>or advantage by it, that we do incur God's heavieſt diſpleaſure, and render our ſelves liable to eternal miſery; and ſo proceed</p>
            <p n="2">II. To enquire who thoſe are that do run this great danger, they who <hi>eat and drink unworthily.</hi> Now this phraſe of <hi>eating unworthily</hi> being onely found here in this Chapter, for the underſtanding of it we are to conſider what the faults were with which the Apoſtle chargeth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and we ſhall find them to be ſome very heinous diſorders that had crept in amongſt them, occaſioned by their Love-feaſts, at the end of which the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was uſually celebrated; which diſorders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were peculiar to thoſe times, and are not now to be found amongſt us, as, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Firſt of all, when ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Church, I hear that there be diviſions among you,</hi> they bandied into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate parties; and <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>In eating every one taketh before another his own ſupper;</hi> that is, Whereas there was a cuſtome when they came together to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Chriſt's death, to furniſh a common table, where no man was to pretend any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60424:27"/>propriety to what he himſelf brought, but was to eat in common with the reſt, this charitable cuſtome theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> wholly perverted: for he that brought a great deal, fell to that as if it were at his own houſe, and at his own table, and ſo fed to the full; whereas another that was able to bring but a little, remained hungry. With ſuch irreverence and diſorder did they behave themſelves at the Lord's Table, as if they had been met at a common feaſt: this the Apoſtle calls <hi>not diſcerning the Lord's body;</hi> that is, they made no difference between that heavenly food and common bread; they ate the Sacrament as if it were their ordinary meat. <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he <hi>v.</hi> 22.) <hi>have ye not houſes to eat and drink in?</hi> ye may e'en as well ſtay at home and doe this; there is nothing of Religion in this, nor is this to celebrate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to Chriſt's inſtitution, whereby we ought to repreſent his death for the world, and to commemorate his love, and to devote our ſelves to him in new and better obedience, and not to make it a merry meeting onely to fill our own bellies.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60424:27"/>
            <p>But this was not all; for they were alſo riotous and intemperate in theſe Love-feaſts. They play'd the gluttons, and were drunk even when they received the holy Sacrament. Now this was ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and foul a prophanation of the holy Myſtery, to make it an inſtrument of debauchery, that we cannot at all wonder that God ſhould ſo ſeverely threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and puniſh ſuch an high affront and violation of his ſacred ordinance. No judgment could be too great or ſharp to vindicate our Saviour's moſt excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution from ſuch impious contempt. But now this is by no means to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to every little failure or omiſſion in this duty, or in our preparation for it, as if that did render us ſuch unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, or ſtreight conſign us over to the ſame puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſcandalous irregularities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes are here called <hi>eating and drinking unworthily,</hi> which were heard of onely in the firſt ages of the Church, when the Sacrament was always joined with theſe Love-feaſts, which were therefore in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time wholly abrogated; and to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60424:28"/>prevent that intemperance and abuſe they had introduced, it generally prevailed to receive this Sacrament faſting. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever faults may be found now amongſt our Communicants, yet they cannot be charged with theſe mentioned in this Chapter. The worſt of men, if they do communicate at all, doe it with greater reverence and more ſuitable deportment than theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> did. So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fault here reproved, nor the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment denounced, hath place now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. What reaſon then is there, why this text of Scripture ſhould fright any people from the Sacrament, whenas there is neither the ſame fault committed, nor the ſame puniſhment inflicted?</p>
            <p>Though this be the juſt meaning of the words, yet becauſe this plea of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs to receive is often inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to excuſe our neglect of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall farther and more largely conſider it by proceeding to the third thing I propounded to diſcourſe of.</p>
            <p n="3">III. How far this danger of receiving unworthily may reaſonably ſcare and fright people from coming to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60424:28"/>And here I ſhall offer theſe few things to the thoughts of all ſuch as are ſeriouſly diſpoſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a ſtrict ſenſe we are none of us all worthy of ſo great a favour and ſuch an high privilege as to be admitted to this Sacrament, or of ſuch excellent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits as are conferred upon us in it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all our care, after all our preparation to make our ſelves fit, yet ſtill we muſt acknowledge our ſelves <hi>unworthy but to pick up the crums that fall from our maſter's table,</hi> much more to ſit and feaſt at it. If we are not to receive this Sacrament till we can account our ſelves really wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, the beſt of men, the more holy and humble they are, the more averſe would they be from this duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This unworthineſs is no bar or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to our receiving this Sacrament. We are not worthy of the leaſt mercy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual or temporal which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; muſt we therefore ſtarve our ſelves or go naked, becauſe we deſerve not our food or rayment? We are not worthy ſo much as to caſt up our eyes towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the habitation of God's holineſs; but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60424:29"/>what then, Shall we never make our humble addreſſes to the throne of God's grace, becauſe we are not worthy to ask, or to have our petitions heard and granted by him? Shall we refuſe any favours the kindneſs of Heaven offers to us, becauſe they are beyond our merits, or more than we could challenge or expect?</p>
            <p>It is not ſaid here in the <hi>Text,</hi> he that is <hi>unworthy</hi> to eat and drink of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he doth it, <hi>eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf;</hi> if it were, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we might all be juſtly afraid of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this royal feaſt, but he that eateth and drinketh <hi>unworthily:</hi> now there is a great deal of difference between theſe two things, between a man's being <hi>unworthy</hi> to receive this Sacrament, and his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it <hi>unworthily,</hi> which I ſhall thus il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate.</p>
            <p>He, for example, who hath groſly wrong'd, malitiouſly ſlander'd, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any provocation of mine treated me very ill, is, as ye will all grant, utterly unworthy of any kindneſs or favour from me. But now if, notwithſtanding this unworthineſs, I doe him ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60424:29"/>kindneſs, and offer him ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, his unworthineſs is no let or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to his receiving it; and if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts it with a due ſenſe and a gratefull mind, and by it is moved to lay aſide all his former enmity and animoſity, and heartily repents him of his former ill-will againſt me, and ſtudies how to requite this courteſie, it is then plain that though he were unworthy of the favour, yet he hath now received it worthily, that is, after a due manner, as he ought to have done, and that it hath had its right effect upon him.</p>
            <p>So we are all unworthy to partake of this holy banquet, but being invited and admitted we may behave our ſelves as becometh us in ſuch a preſence, at ſuch a ſolemnity. And if by it we thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commemorate the death of our Lord, and renounce all our ſins and former evil ways, and there give up our ſelves to be governed by him, and vow better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and are affected with a true ſenſe of his love, then, though unworthy of ſo great a favour, yet we have worthily, that is after a right manner (as to God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance) received this bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60424:30"/>But if now unworthy of ſo great honour and favour, we alſo receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily after a prophane diſorderly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not at an minding the end, uſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, without any repentance for ſins paſt, or reſolutions of amendment for the future, and without any gratefull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of love towards our Saviour dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, we do by this means indeed highly provoke God Almighty, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incur his moſt grievous diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe who are unworthy and are truly ſenſible of their own unworthineſs, are the very perſons for whom this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was appointed, and for whoſe benefit it was inſtituted. Were we not all ſinners we had no need of ſuch means of grace as Sacraments are, nor of ſuch inſtruments of Religion. <hi>Chriſt came not to call the righteous but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. They that are whole need not the phyſician but they that are ſick.</hi> Now it is an idle thing for a man to be afraid to receive an aims becauſe he is miſerably poor, or to be loth to take phyſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is dangerouſly ſick. If we are truly ſenſible of our unworthineſs, and, as we ought to be, duly affected with it,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60424:30"/>this is a great argument and motive to engage us not any longer to delay the uſe of theſe means, but to haſten to the Sacrament, there to receive ſupplies and aſſiſtances ſuitable and proportioned to our wants and neceſſities: the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy we find our ſelves, the more we ſtand in need of this holy Sacrament, whereby our good reſolutions may be ſtrengthened and confirmed, and divine power and grace communicated to us, to enable us by degrees to ſubdue all our luſts and paſſions, and to reſiſt all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſo by often receiving this Sacrament we ſhall every time become leſs unworthy to partake of it.</p>
            <p>There hath been a great diſpute in the world whether the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper be a converting ordinance or no, as prayer and hearing of the word of God read or preached are allowed to be; and many there are that have been brought to believe, that it is a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on, or rather a privilege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to none but great and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saints, to ſtrong and well-grounded Chriſtians; that this Sacrament is not food proper for babes and novices, for thoſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60424:31"/>who often fail in their duty, who are ſtill onely wreſtling with their luſts, but have not yet got the maſtery or victory over them; that we ought firſt to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured of our ſalvation before we come to this holy table, that this ordinance ſerves onely to ſtrengthen and confirm our faith and repentance and all other Chriſtian graces and vertues, but not to beget any of them in us.</p>
            <p>Now here thus much muſt be granted, that this Sacrament doth belong onely to thoſe that are within the pale of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, onely to baptiſed Chriſtians that do publickly own their faith and Chriſtian profeſſion; that it is no means of converting Jews or Infidels; and that even Chriſtians by notorious evil lives, whereby they become ſcandalous to their brethren and incur the cenſures of the Church, may juſtly forfeit all their right and title to this Sacrament; and farther, that it is a bold prophanation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's inſtitution for any wicked perſon, reſolved to continue ſuch, to preſume to bleſs God for that mercy and love of a Redeemer which he doth not in the leaſt value. Thus far we are on all hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60424:31"/>but not now to engage in any matter of controverſie, I ſhall onely ſay that I can ſee no reaſon why to one that is really ſenſible of his ſins and miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages contrary to his baptiſmal vow and profeſſion, and maketh ſome kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to forſake them; why, I ſay, this Sacrament as well as prayer or any other duties of Religion may not be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as a means of begetting true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in him, of turning him from ſin to righteouſneſs, from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God; and for this I ſhall offer one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this one plain argument which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every man, that if the death of Chriſt it ſelf, his bitter paſſion, his whole gratious undertaking for us, was amongſt other reaſons deſigned by God alſo to convince us of the evil and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſin, to bring us out of love with it, and to engage us to a new and better life, ſurely then the conſideration of the ſame things repreſented to us in the Sacrament, the commemoration of his death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there made, may alſo ſerve for the ſame great ends and purpoſes.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt died that we ſhould die unto ſin, certainly then the memory of his death
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60424:32"/>may juſtly be accounted a proper means of killing ſin in us; nay what in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing can be imagined a more likely inſtrument to turn us from a life of ſin to the practice of holineſs, than the frequent conſideration of what our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord hath done and ſuffered for us? and if ſo, it cannot be neceſſary that this change ſhould be completely wrought in us, before we ever ſolemnly commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his bloudy paſſion, for that were to ſuppoſe it neceſſary that the end ſhould be obtained before we uſe the means.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould be fully aſſured that we are in a ſtate of grace, and in God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and have repented enough and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſaken all our ſins before we venture on this Sacrament; it is ſufficient that we heartily and ſincerely reſolve againſt them, that we approach the Lord's table with honeſt and devout minds, that we be really willing and deſirous to uſe all means to become better, and if thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed we come to the Sacrament, I doubt not but we ſhall find it a moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means for the enabling us to leave our ſins, and to lead a better life. It is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60424:32"/>not our unworthineſs, but our reſolving to continue in that ſtate, that makes us unqualified for this Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If therefore by your unworthineſs you mean that you live in ſin and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to doe ſo, and therefore dare not come to the Sacrament for fear you ſhould farther provoke God almighty, I will ſuppoſe that in this you act prudently and warily, but then I would adviſe you for the ſame reaſon and on the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to leave off all other duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as well as this; if you would act upon the ſame grounds, you ought to reckon it the ſafeſt way never to pray to God any more, nor ever again to appear in any religious aſſemblies, nor to join in any part of God's ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for God hath often declared that he doth far more abominate all ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, whining, cringing hypocrites, and will more ſeverely puniſh them than the open and bold contemners of his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and laws. <hi>The prayer of the wicked man is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> He hates the addreſſes of thoſe who call him <hi>father</hi> and <hi>maſter,</hi> and in words acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, but yet continually doe the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60424:33"/>things that are diſpleaſing in his ſight. His ſoul loaths and nauſeates all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of impure worſhippers: You do but mock God, baſely fawn upon and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently flatter him, when you preſent your ſelves before him as his people and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and yet ſecretly hate him and wiſh him out of the world; nay for the ſame reaſon for which you forbear the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment e'en lay aſide your whole Chriſtian profeſſion, openly renounce your Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, deny your Saviour, diſown his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for that is the ſafeſt courſe whilſt you reſolve to continue in ſin and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for God's wrath ſhall be in the firſt place revealed againſt wicked Chriſtians, and better will it be in the laſt day for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> than for thoſe who were called by Chriſt's name, and yet did not depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p>If this pretence be true, that you go out of the Church when the Sacrament is to be adminiſtred, leſt you ſhould far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provoke God by unworthy receiving it, by the ſame reaſon keep from the Church altogether, leſt you as highly provoke God by being preſent at thoſe prayers you do not heartily join in, nor
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60424:33"/>ever intend to live according to. Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to ſpeak yet more fully, what is the true conſequence of this) you now know your ſelves unworthy, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved yet, at leaſt for ſome time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch; alas! what need ſuch as you be afraid of this Text? In this caſe it ought to ſeem indifferent to you whether you receive or not; Damnation here threatned cannot be ſuppoſed reaſonably to ſcare him from the Sacrament, who runs the conſtant hazard of it by living in known ſin. This can be no ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible word to an habitual and reſolved ſinner. He that can ſwear and talk pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely, and live intemperately and looſely, and without any fear or regret commit mortal ſin, in vain pretends fear of damnation for not doing that which is indeed his duty; for it is a moſt odd and ridiculous thing to be afraid of doing what our Saviour hath commanded us, whilſt we are not in the leaſt afraid every day of doing what he hath forbidden us. How ſtrange is this for men out of a dread of damnation to neglect their duty, and yet at the ſame time not to be afraid to live carnal and ſenſual lives? Never therefore let any amongſt you, ſo long
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60424:34"/>as you continue in your ſins, plead, that you are afraid you ſhould offend your Saviour if unworthily you eat his body and drink his bloud, and therefore dare not communicate; for your daily prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice confutes this pretence, whilſt you notoriouſly break his Laws, and violate his Authority and ſcandalize his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>You pretend fear of damnation; no ſuch matter, this is not the true reaſon of your abſtaining from this Sacrament. You are rather afraid the Sacrament will engage you to leave thoſe ſins you have no mind as yet to part with, that it will put you upon the practice of thoſe duties which are inconſiſtent with your profit, pleaſure, or ſecular intereſt. You are not afraid of diſpleaſing God, but of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſtrictly tied and bound to pleaſe him. You are afraid leſt that ſolemnity ſhould raiſe ſome ſcruples in your minds which you have no leiſure to conſider of. You would not be troubled with ſuch a ſerious buſineſs; you ſuſpect you ſhall not be able to ſin ſo ſecurely and quietly after it, as now you do.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60424:34"/>
            <p>Let not ſuch therefore as neglect this duty, invent any ſuch pitifull excuſes, but confeſs plainly that they love ſin and the world too much, that they prize them above the benefits purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt, that they reſolve to go on in their wickedneſs for ſome longer time, and that therefore they do not come to this Sacrament. They are loth to engage themſelves ſo ſolemnly to doe that, which they find in themſelves no heart or will to perform. This indeed is the ſecret thought of many men, though indeed it is a very fooliſh one: for they are very much miſtaken who think themſelves at greater liberty to doe evil whilſt they abſtain from this Sacrament, for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are engaged by receiving this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to no other obedience than they were before by their Baptiſm: it doth not ſo much oblige us to new duties, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to make good thoſe obligations which our profeſſion of Chriſtianity hath already laid upon us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And Laſtly. If the receiving of this Sacrament were an indifferent rite or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, that might be done or omitted
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60424:35"/>at pleaſure, then indeed the great danger there is in receiving it unworthily might in a great meaſure juſtify our omiſſion of it. But what if the danger be as great and the hazard equal of not receiving it at all, as of receiving it unworthily? where then is our prudence or ſafety, when to avoid one danger, we run into another every whit as great? when for fear of diſpleaſing God, we diſobey a plain command, and for fear of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commit a damnable ſin? for I can call it no leſs, to live in the neglect and contempt of this holy inſtitution.</p>
            <p>It is not very eaſie to determine which is the greateſt affront to God, or doth moſt highly provoke him, never to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our duty, or to perform it after a wrong manner; never to pray at all, or to be preſent at prayers, but not to mind or regard what we are about; never to receive this Sacrament, or to receive it often, but make no difference between what we and drink there, and what eat we do at our own houſes. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he that receives this Sacrament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be after an undue manner, ſeems to me to ſhew ſomewhat more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God and his commands, than
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60424:35"/>he who wholly neglects it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is hardly any wicked man that dares come to the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome good thoughts and reſolutions, or who is not for a little time before and after the receiving of it more carefull of himſelf and his actions; and though this doth not laſt long, but he ſoon returns to his former wickedneſs, yet however this is ſomething better than continuing in ſin and wickedneſs without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or ceſſation. Moreover, ſuch an one uſes the beſt means of becoming bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by God's grace at ſome time may prove effectual; whereas he that caſts off all theſe duties is in a more deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and irreclaimable ſtate.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, were there neither ſin nor danger in omitting this Sacrament, and yet ſo great hazard in the receiving it unworthily, prudence and intereſt might engage us to chuſe the ſafeſt ſide, and not to meddle with it at all; but if we expoſe our ſelves as certainly to God's anger and diſpleaſure by wholly neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this duty, as by performing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly, then theſe words of the Apoſtle can be no pretence or excuſe for our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60424:36"/>from this Communion. For would not this be an odd way of arguing? becauſe intemperate eating and drinking is very prejudicial to our health, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten breeds mortal diſeaſes, therefore 'tis better never to eat or drink at all? would it not be madneſs, leſt we ſhould kill our ſelves by a ſurfeit, to reſolve to ſtarve our ſelves by obſtinate faſting?</p>
            <p>And this ſhall bring me to the fourth and laſt thing I propounded to diſcourſe of; which was</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To ſhew what is the onely true and juſt conſequence which can be drawn from what is here affirmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf,</hi> which is this: that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as our Saviour hath plainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all his Followers and Diſciples, to doe this in remembrance of him; and yet on the other ſide, there is ſo great danger in doing it unworthily, that we ſhould neither omit the duty (for that would be a plain tranſgreſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's command) nor yet be careleſs in the performance of it.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60424:36"/>
            <p>And this is the inference which the Apoſtle himſelf makes, not that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> whom he blames ſo much for their unworthy receiving this Sacrament, ſhould therefore forbear coming to it any more at all, but for the future they ſhould examine themſelves, and partake of it with greater reverence and devotion than they had uſed to do. Let the danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving unworthily be never ſo great, the conſideration of this ought onely to make us ſo much the more carefull to receive it after a right and acceptable manner, and to put us upon greater watchfulneſs over our ſelves when we meddle with ſuch ſacred things. This is the uſe we ought to make of theſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, not raſhly or precipitantly without due preparation or conſideration to ruſh upon this holy Sacrament, but ſeriouſly to mind the end and deſign of it, and ſo duely to affect our ſpirits with the things repreſented to us by it, that they may make lively and laſting impreſſions upon us, and we may bring forth the fruit of all in a holy and unblamable converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60424:37"/>
            <p>To end all, I would not have any thing I have now ſaid upon this ſubject to you, ſo interpreted or underſtood, as in the leaſt to take away from the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence you have of this inſtitution, or to leſſen that awe and dread you have of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it unworthily. Onely I would not have men afraid of, or ſcruple doing their duty. There is preparation and good diſpoſition of mind required for prayer and the right performance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious duties, as well as this of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>We ought therefore to be afraid of theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of neglecting to receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that is to live in diſobedience to a plain command of our Saviour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of receiving it unworthily without reverence or attention to the meaning of it, without hearty repentance and ſincere reſolution of amendment, for that is to affront and prophane our Saviour's moſt excellent inſtitution.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60424:37"/>
            <p n="3">3. Of turning to your evil courſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receiving it: for then your having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Sacrament will be a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation both of your ſin and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN Scripture we often find that the evil Spirits are repreſented as <hi>Tempters, going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it, ſeeking whom they may devour;</hi> and to that end as fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60424:39"/>with all manner of wiles and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, by which they may enſnare and deceive Mankind. They would not be unhappy alone, and therefore bend all their ſtudy and cunning to involve Men in the ſame ruine they have plunged themſelves into.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe are not our <hi>onely</hi> Enemies, whom we are to watch againſt or reſiſt. There are many in our own ſhape, who though their Feet are not cloven, yet drive on the ſame deſign, and are the Devil's Agents, and uſe their wit and parts to ſet up his Kingdom in the World, by enticing Men to, and pleading for Sin and Irreligion. And this they doe juſt for the ſame ill-natured reaſon; namely, to make others as bad as themſelves, that they may be alſo as miſerable; that this may a little comfort them againſt the gnawing fears of future puniſhments, that if they ſhould chance to befall them, as is threatned, yet they have made ſure of company enough.</p>
            <p>And this may afford us one Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of no little force to ſecure us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſolicitations of Sinners, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60424:39"/>though they may pretend to great love and kindneſs, and tell us of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and bravery of being wicked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to anſwer all the ſcruples and coyneſs of our Conſciences; yet the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all is onely to engage us in the perills and dangerous adventures they have run themſelves into: They cannot endure to think that if the great Doctrines of Religion ſhould at laſt prove true, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould be likely to fare better in the other ſtate than themſelves; they hope either by their number to bear down God Almighty to pity and pardon, or at leaſt that when they are ſo many, they ſhall help one another more chearfully to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the worſt that can happen to them.</p>
            <p>But now would we count it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Man to perſuade us to be ſick with him? or becauſe he hath undone himſelf and is loſt and ruin'd, that we ſhould therefore bring our ſelves into the ſame circumſtances and condition? In our temporal affairs we are not thus eaſie and flexible, nor can Men in their wits by any means be prevailed upon to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their lives and fortunes for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the vain humour of any deſperate
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60424:40"/>perſon, who hath forfeited his own; and why then ſhould we be ſo fooliſhly ſoft as to part with all that can be called tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, and venture our everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments and immortal Souls onely to bear thoſe company who are reſolved to be damned? Wherefore of old in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where civility and good manners have obtained, ſuch as have taken up that vile trade of debauching others, and enticing them to ſin, have been always branded with marks of infamy, and accounted and dealt with, as the very peſts and publick enemies of mankind.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe there is not much need of convincing you, that it is your intereſt to follow this advice of the wiſe man. Every one will readily grant that it is good and wholeſome counſel, not to conſent to the enticings of evil and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; the onely difficulty is in the practiſing of it, eſpecially in a time when ſin is not onely grown into faſhion, but into very great reputation.</p>
            <p>It would be well if the ſad complaints of the hideous degeneracy and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this preſent age were as unjuſt as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60424:40"/>they are frequent; it is the humour of too many to admire and commend all the perſons that lived, and every thing that was done before they were born, whilſt they pleaſe themſelves in nothing more than in continually lamenting and bemoaning the ſins and misfortunes of their own days. And whatever times ſuch had lived in, 'tis like they would have pickt out matter of diſcontent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no better way of ſhewing their own wiſedom or goodneſs than by finding fault with others. But however thus much is certain, that ſince the World is always ſo throng'd and thickly beſet with wicked men (and we have no reaſon to doubt but that we at this time have our ſhare of them amongſt us) ſince the beſt of us all are ſo apt to be miſled, ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or betrayed into ſin, we have great need, if we would preſerve our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, to fortifie our minds with all ſuch conſiderations as may help us to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the reſtleſs allurements and ſubtile enticing of thoſe, who not onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves doe things that are evil, but rejoice in making others doe the ſame.</p>

            <p>I ſhall at this time diſcourſe onely of theſe two ways by which thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice men to vitious practices ordinarily prevail with them, <hi>viz.</hi> either by their example, or elſe by arguing for and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing of ſin, and ſhall endeavour to make out how unreaſonable it is to be moved by either of them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Conſent not when you are enticed to ſin by bad examples.</hi> He that is tempted one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his own wicked ſelf, and <hi>drawn away with his own luſts,</hi> doubts oftentimes and is afraid, and ſometimes repents and forbears; but when his own inward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions and inclinations are ſeconded and back'd with bad examples, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they are numerous and given by men of authority, intereſt and name in the World; when by them he is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and urged to that which of himſelf he had no little mind to; then doth Vice become ſtrong and triumphant, the temptation is then at the full height, and it is hard for a Man to ſtand it out. When thus there is a confederacy and combination of ſinners, when <hi>wickedneſs joins,</hi> as it were, <hi>hand to hand,</hi> and draws
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60424:41"/>it ſelf into leagues, when the road is ſmoothed and the paſſage made broad and plain by the tramplings of others before us, then we are in great danger either of being hurried on in the Crowd or elſe of being by degrees inveigled to venture our ſelves with thoſe to whom we cannot but think we do owe a great regard. Vice then becomes popular and creditable, and he that ſtartles at the commiſſion of any Sin when he is alone, ſhall make no ſtop or ſcruple when he hath the invitation and approbation of ſo many; for he ſins now by conſent and ſympathy, and hath the opinion of others to vouch him; when Conſcience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, or vertuous men reprove him, he hath his authorities ready to produce for his wickedneſs, and can quote others to juſtifie his debaucheries.</p>
            <p>Sin is infectious, and when it once gets head, and men dare be openly prophane, it ſpreads like a contagious diſeaſe; and though for ſome time we ſhould keep our ſelves untainted, yet by degrees we ſhall be apt to loſe that averſeneſs and abhorrence we had of it; it will not ſeem ſo ſtrange and diſmal a thing to us, it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60424:42"/>will become more familiar, and then we ſhall proceed to wiſh our ſelves free that we might alſo doe the ſame; to long and hancker after a greater liberty, to think our ſelves too hard tied up, and then the next ſtep is running with others into the like exceſs of riot. The ſenſe and apprehenſion we have of any danger cannot but be much abated when we ſee the greateſt part of men continually to outbrave, and daringly to defie it, and it is hard to retain a juſt value for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when it is deſpiſed and contemned by thoſe who are famed for their wit and prudence in other things.</p>
            <p>But though by experience we find that examples do thus ſtrongly influence men, yet that they ſhould doe ſo, reaſon there is none: for what can argue greater ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and unmanlineſs than at a venture to take every thing for better for worſe, and to go on onely for company ſake, and leave all matters, though we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo deeply concerned in them, to be judged of onely by others? What doth reaſon or underſtanding advantage him who lives wholly by precedent, and is always what others pleaſe to make him?</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60424:42"/>
            <p>
               <q>But alas! it is very tedious and troubleſome for a man to examine his own ways, and ask himſelf a reaſon of every ſtep he takes. It would coſt too much time and pains to be wary and thoughtfull, and conſider always what ought to be ſpoken or done next; this is a dull and methodical way of living: but to be always poiſed, to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to every thing, to wait the next tide, and to follow the next hint, this is gay, and free, and eaſie.</q> But be it as eaſie as it will, it is nevertheleſs no other than the life of Beaſts who herd together, and follow one another, and love to be in the ſame track.</p>
            <p>But more particularly; men are led by examples, and tempted to doe as the moſt doe, chiefly on one of theſe accounts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they may not be thought ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, or which is worſe rude and unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or elſe that they may avoid ſcoffs and reproaches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To avoid the imputation of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity: and this indeed muſt neceſſarily be laid to the charge of good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60424:43"/>men, ſo long as the greateſt part of the World is wicked and ſenſual: But then it is to be conſidered that it is ſuch a ſingularity as is moſt honourable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds the more to our credit, by how much the fewer are of our ſide. 'Tis true, to affect ſingularity in any indifferent or trivial matter is unbecoming and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; but Men were never afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingular in any excellency: and though Religion and innocence may not always meet with that eſteem, which is due to them, yet it is ſtrange that any one ſhould ever think them ſcandalous.</p>
            <p>If this caſt any diſparagement upon piety and vertue, that there are but few in the World that heartily regard them, it does equally on all things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and really praiſe-worthy. Are men aſhamed of being counted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in any knowledge or wiſedom, in any skill or trade? and why ſhould it be otherwiſe in the inſtance of true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the higheſt perfection our natures are capable of? are not great honours and eſtates as liable to this exception, ſince there are but few that can deſerve the one or acquire the other? and yet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60424:43"/>men rather vaunt and glory in ſuch things as theſe, which diſtinguiſh them from the vulgar rout, and uſually reckon thoſe the moſt deſirable accompliſhments which few are maſters of; why then ſhould this prejudice men againſt Religion, that the greateſt part of the World are fools, and are contented to be miſerable?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt follow, ſay they, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of others, and doe as the moſt doe, or elſe we ſhall be counted rude and uncivil; we ſhall be thought ill-manner'd and to want faſhionable breeding. And this alone hath ſo far prevailed in the World, that I doubt not but there are many who make themſelves ſeem to be worſe than really they are, and boaſt of ſins which they never durſt commit, onely that they may not be without this mark and character of Gentility; who hypocritically diſſemble wickedneſs, that they may gain the name and reputation of Gentlemen, and may not be thought preciſe or godly.</p>
            <p>But ſurely it is a ſign of a mean, low and baſe ſpirit, and doth not ſuit with that braveneſs and gallantry of mind,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60424:44"/>which is or ought to be in all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to ſuffer themſelves thus to be uſurped upon, and ſo tamely to ſubmit to mere wicked cuſtomes; and inſtead of all thoſe good qualities and diſpoſitions and vertuous actions to which their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers owed their good names and great titles, to value themſelves or others upon the account of ſuch vices, as in former times were found onely in Clowns and Beggars.</p>
            <p>This indeed is the proof of a very wicked and degenerate age, and a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſign that irreligion appears with a very bold face, when it is accounted a piece of bad manners and becoming one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of a mean rank to own a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for that Sovereign Majeſty who made us all, and a due reſpect to thoſe Laws, which not ſo much his power and dominion over us, as our own intereſt and ſelf-love do oblige us to obſerve; when we ſhall be called rude unleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the hopes of eternal happineſs, we fooliſhly hazard the loſs of our health, peace, and every thing elſe that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valuable for a momentany ſatisfaction merely out of compliance with our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60424:44"/>when to be able to walk, ſtand, or ſpeak ſenſe, ſhall be thought an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent thing, an uncivil trick put upon thoſe whom we either chanc'd or were forced to converſe with; to name no more, when it ſhall be eſteemed leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to be a murtherer than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſome petty injury, or put up any ſmall affront. We ſhould therefore in this caſe ſay as <hi>David</hi> did when he dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the Ark of the Lord, and was derided for it, <hi>If this be vile, I will yet be more vile than thus.</hi> If meekneſs and patience, chaſtity and temperance, the fear of God and true Religion be uncivil and ungentile, we will yet be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil and ungentile; and I ſhould as ſoon be perſuaded that it was rude and clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh not to pledge one who drank to me in rank poyſon, as that it is any ſign of want of good breeding and gentile ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, to be wiſer and more ſober than the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Men are tempted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with bad examples and follow the multitude, that they may avoid ſcoffs and reproaches, and not expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the laughter and drollery of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60424:45"/>thoſe who think every thing wit that is impudent or prophane. But this ſurely is ſo little and inconſiderable that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be named with the leaſt of thoſe inconveniences which attend a wicked life; for what hurt can it be to us to have thoſe ſpeak ill of us, whoſe very commendation and good word would be our greateſt ſcandal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? and ſhall we to eſcape their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious ſcoffs and fooliſh jeſts, juſtly merit the reproof of all wiſe men, and make our ſelves liable to the cenſure of thoſe whoſe opinion and judgment alone ought to be regarded?</p>
            <p>Were we but once throughly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the truth and excellency of that Religion we are baptized into, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py it would make us in this life, and what great things it aſſures us of in the future, no flouts nor railleries would any more be able to ſhake our purpoſes of good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, than they are to perſuade a rich man out of his eſtate and large poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions.</p>
            <p>But farther, the beſt way to preſerve our reputation, even amongſt wicked
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60424:45"/>men, is to be true to thoſe principles which we have firſt eſpouſed; for let men ſay what they will, they have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret reſpect and veneration for all thoſe whoſe goodneſs is exemplary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous (which appears ſufficiently by their envying and ſnarling at them) and they inwardly ſcorn none more than thoſe whom they know to be guilty of thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which yet they themſelves tempted them to, and he that will be drunk him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will yet be ſure to laugh at another whom he ſees in that condition.</p>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe the worſt, what is it that they can ſay of us? onely that we are nice, and ſqueamiſh, and curious; that we have not yet learned to live at random, nor perfectly ſubdued our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; that we weigh and conſider our actions, and uſe our reaſons and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and believe we were born into the World for ſome higher ends than plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſenſes, and gratifying our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; that we are not indifferent to health and ſickneſs, peace and diſquiet, life and death; that we think there is ſomewhat in the World beſides what we daily ſee; that we provide for a State
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60424:46"/>which we may very ſoon enter upon, and trouble our ſelves with thoughts of what will become of us after we are dead, and the like: but if this be all, we ought to pray to God that we may conſtantly live under ſuch ignominy and die under the diſgrace.</p>
            <p>To what I have already ſaid on this ſubject, I ſhall onely add, that if bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples even againſt our reaſon and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt do ſo far prevail with Men to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter undoing, what mighty power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence would good examples have, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with all the arguments for and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Religion? what an age of vertue, and quiet, and happineſs ſhould we enjoy, if Men of dignity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, of parts and underſtanding, of birth and fortune, would freely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly offer themſelves to the World for patterns of life and converſation? thus they might entice others to be good, and ſoon retrieve the honour of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and bring it again into credit and repute. Were ſuch Mens lives as good and holy as their profeſſion is, ſinners would ſoon be put out of Countenance, and be aſhamed to appear in the World,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60424:46"/>their party would be made inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they would have but little power to draw others over to their ſide: for there is not a more winning and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſight in the World, than the life of a Chriſtian led exactly according to the preſcripts of his Religion. And were there not in all ages ſome ſuch perſons of authority and fame, whoſe zeal for Religion inſpires them with ſo much courage, as that they are neither aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nor afraid of being honeſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, whatever the mad World may ſay or think of them for it (I ſay, were it not for ſuch) we ſhould ſoon loſe not onely the power but even the form of Godlineſs too. And God onely knows how many daily make ſhipwrack of their Conſciences, onely becauſe they have not ſpirit enough to endure to be out of the mode and faſhion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But I haſten to the ſecond thing propounded, which was to ſhew how unreaſonable it is to be enticed to ſin, by ſuch as argue for it, and would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to excuſe it, for there are many that are not altogether thus eaſie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, as to follow merely for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60424:47"/>nor ſo lazy as to take up every thing on truſt, but they are men of prudence and diſcretion, who deſire firſt to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied whether what they are inticed to be prudent and ſafe; they like a wicked life well enough, could they be but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſome ſmall reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it, by which they might juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their choice and ſtop the mouths of their Conſciences. I ſhall juſt mention theſe four ways whereby ſinners ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily entice ſuch as theſe to join with them, either 1. by repreſenting the pleaſures; or 2. by propounding the temporal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which attend ſin; or elſe 3. by ſpeaking ſlightly of the evil of it; or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by perſuading them that there is no danger in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Men entice others to ſin by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding to them the pleaſures that are to be found in a looſe and wicked life. <q>They tell them that the laws of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are fitted onely for the dull and Phlegmatick, unactive and Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack, who grudge at others enjoying thoſe delights which themſelves are not capable of; that Nature deſigned we ſhould freely uſe whatever ſhe hath
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60424:47"/>provided for our entertainment here, and was not ſo unkind as perpetually to torment us with the ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſuch things as we are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to taſte nor touch; that heaven indeed is the Lord's and he dwells there, and doeth what pleaſeth him beſt, but that the earth by his grant and permiſſion is ours, and who ſhall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or diſturb us? that God hath left this lower World to us to take our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime therein, and that that man makes the beſt uſe of it, who improves it moſt to ſerve his own pleaſures; that to live honeſtly, ſcrupulouſly and vertuouſly is to be buried whilſt we are alive; and that to order all our actions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſtinted rules and precepts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to ſlaves and thoſe who are of a ſervile diſpoſition; but what greater pleaſure, ſay they, than to be ungovernable and uncontrollable, to ſatisfy every appetite with its proper object, to deny our ſelves nothing that our luſts or paſſions crave, in every thing to gratifie our own humour and fancy, and to trouble our heads with nothing, unleſs it be to find out new delights and ſurprizing extravagancies?</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:60424:48"/>
            <p>But what are all theſe now other than the vain conceits of mad Men, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their phrenzy do many times think themſelves the wiſeſt, greateſt and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt Men in the World, and take as much delight in ſuch idle dreams as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do in real enjoyments? but this pleaſure laſts no longer than till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the uſe of their underſtandings, and therefore in this caſe we are not to give credit to what wicked Men ſay, nor judge of the pleaſure and content of their lives by what outwardly appears. <hi>Even in laughter the heart is ſorrowfull,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon;</hi> and it is very poſſible for one who ſeems to ſpend all his days in mirth and jollity yet really to be in a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie condition all the while; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from this, that ſuch as are ſenſual and licentious find it beſt to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a continual hurry and heat, and as ſoon as they are tired with one ſin, preſently to betake themſelves to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for fear they ſhould unhappily light upon a Bible or a ſober thought: for this reaſon it is that they hate nothing ſo much as to be alone, and be forced to converſe with themſelves, and that if they chance to fall into any affliction or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60424:48"/>calamity they are the moſt dejected and diſconſolate perſons in the World; all theſe are certain ſigns that they are haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with dreadfull and ghaſtly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and jealouſies, which will ever and anon be crouding in, and ſometimes even when they are taking their fill of pleaſures.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, Religion denies us no pleaſures which are manly and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our natures, and forbids us onely ſuch exceſſes as in themſelves are both te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and nauſeous; and layeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that ſolid peace and joy, which no external thing whatever is able to ſhake or diſcompoſe.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, if to be carried away with every vanity and whimſie, to be ſwayed by every unreaſonable humour and luſt, to be a ſlave to every Man's frolick and beck; to try the utmoſt ſtrength of our bodies, to run a courſe of all diſeaſes, to undergoe all reproach and infamy, to ſpend our eſtates and time in purſuit of ſhort life, rotten bones, and wretched poverty; if this be pleaſure, then for certain there is enough of it to be found in a diſſolute and vitious life.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60424:49"/>
            <p n="2">2. With ſuch as are not altogether ſo fool-hardy, and but a little better huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of their health and eſtates, this kind of Philoſophy will not take at all, but if you would get them into a good opinion of wickedneſs, it muſt be by propounding to them ſome temporal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Vertue or vice is very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to ſuch, but what they can ſave or get moſt by, is always the beſt. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and gain do ſtrangely mollifie ſin, and take away much from the odiouſneſs and uglineſs of it; it ſhall be the moſt juſt and equitable thing in the World, if it can help us to raiſe a new family or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover one that is decayed; if it may ſerve to maintain our ſelves or relations, if by it we may oblige and obtain the favour of any great men, who will be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending as to admit us into a ſociety with them, though it be onely in their vices: for men are in the worſt inſtances ready to pleaſe and humour thoſe they hope to get ſomething from, or upon whom they depend.</p>
            <p>But to this I ſhall reply nothing, but onely ask our Saviour's queſtion, <hi>What
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60424:49"/>ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoul, or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> If we ſell our integrity and hopes of future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs onely to get a little of this world, we make a fooliſh bargain. And I hope I need ſay no more in this place, ſince thoſe onely who are made of the baſeſt and courſeſt metal, and are of poor and degenerous ſpirits, are capable of being enſnared by this temptation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another way men have of enticing others to ſin is by aſſuring them, that there is no ſuch great evil in it as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly believed; <q>That when once we have conquered our fear of ſinning, we have ſeen the worſt of it; that the evil of ſin lies moſt in a little ſcandal, that is caſt upon it by ſome doting Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or melancholy Enthuſiaſts, or ſome covetous Uſurers, who will not be at the expence of it, or by thoſe who receive tythes to declaim againſt it; that the nature of good and evil hath been always matter of diſpute, and there is hardly any vice but what hath been not onely approved but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by ſome whole Nation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60424:50"/>that at the beſt Religion is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the politick contrivance of ſome wiſe Governours who knew how to manage and make advantage of the ſimplicity and credulity of ignorant people: but that all things are in their own natures indifferent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now is it not ſtrange that men ſhould ever be perſuaded, that it is as good to kill as to obey ones Parents? that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as much commendation when we repay kindneſſes with ill-will and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as when we relieve thoſe that are in neceſſity? that cruelty, treachery and malice are as amiable in themſelves, and as innocent diſpoſitions, as mercifulneſs, fidelity and good nature? and why may we not as well believe that wiſedom is to be found onely in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and that all that hath been ever ſpoken or done by men, hitherto counted in their wits, hath been indeed onely the effect of madneſs and diſtemper'd brains? though ſome politick men, for notable ends, have cunningly made common people for this great while to imagine quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. But I forbear.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:60424:50"/>
            <p n="4">4. And Laſtly; That which prevails moſt powerfully is to perſuade men that there is no great danger in ſin. <q>Some ſins may indeed prove inconvenient, but the pleaſure recompenſeth that; ſome may be of ill report, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will pay off that ſcore; and if ſin ſhould chance to have any evil in it, what's that to us when we are dead? the onely fear is of an after-reckoning.</q> And therefore do they who would fain ſin without controll, eſpecially labour that they may free themſelves and others from all ſuſpicions of a future ſtate; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up every trifling objection that hath been of old uſed by any of the Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Philoſophers, and hath been a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times anſwered; and inventing new ones as far as their wit ſerves them. But if after all there ſtill remain any doubts concerning another life, then they plead how little we know or underſtand of it, or how abſurd it is to think that a man ſhall be for ever puniſhed for what he did by miſtake or ſurprize, or ſtrength of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or height of bloud, or good nature or civility, or to ſave his life, or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his reputation, family, or the like.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:60424:51"/>
            <p>But will nothing convince men of the certainty of future puniſhments but their feeling of them? or do they think that God hath as little regard for thoſe Laws which he hath made, and by which he will govern and judge the world, as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men themſelves have? but ſhould we grant all that can be asked in this caſe, and ſuppoſe it very doubtfull whether our ſouls are immortal, (and ſurely no man will pretend to prove it impoſſible that they ſhould be ſo) nay ſhould we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it great odds that there is not a future ſtate; yet that man doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs moſt notoriouſly betray his want of prudence and diſcretion, who will not contradict his own brutiſh incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and deny himſelf ſome ſhort pleaſures, and chuſe that courſe of life which our reaſon no leſs than our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth recommend to us, rather than run the leaſt hazard (though it were of an hundred to one) of being for ever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. And thus much concerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enticed to wicked practices.</p>
            <p>And now I might diſcourſe at large of another ſort of enticing, which is to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60424:51"/>and pernicious doctrines, and of ſuch as go about to inveigle and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our judgments, and debauch our underſtandings by ſeducing us to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of opinions no leſs wicked than falſe; But I ſhall at preſent onely crave leave briefly to ſhew</p>
            <p n="1">1. What danger men are in of being ſeduced by ſuch temptations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is our beſt armour and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What danger we are in of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed from that profeſſion and belief which is publickly taught and own'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us: which danger ariſes partly from the earneſtneſs, importunity, or the arts that ſubtile men uſe to bring us off; but moſt eſpecially from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines themſelves which they would learn us, and inſtill into us, which are ſuch as are moſt pleaſing and gratefull to one who delights in his ſins; ſuch as cannot but be moſt acceptable to him, as giving him hopes of heaven, though he deny himſelf very little for it; ſuch as lay the grounds and foundations of ſinning chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60424:52"/>without any fear or remorſe; and therefore as long as the greateſt part of the world love vice and eaſe, will ſucceed and be greedily entertained.</p>
            <p>It is no hard matter to perſuade men to believe, what they before-hand wiſh were true; and there needs no great ſtore of proof or arguments to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thoſe opinions to the ſenſual and prophane, which give them leave to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill their luſts without any regret of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or dread of puniſhment. Is it not a comfortable doctrine, and will it not be readily embraced by every reſolved ſinner, that after a long wicked life, at the laſt gaſp a bare ſorrow for ſin out of fear of hell, with the Prieſt's abſolution, ſhall at leaſt free him from eternal pains, and take away the guilt of his ſins, ſo that he need not be afraid of any thing beſides a ſudden death, which happens but ſeldom? When he is at any time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed with the ſenſe of his dangerous condition, when the forced remembrance of his ſins doth gall and fret his mind, and fill him with fears and melancholy thoughts, what a relief muſt it needs be to him, to be aſſured that it is but going
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60424:52"/>to a Prieſt, and confeſſing his ſins, and undergoing ſome ſmall penances, and he is ſafe? for then he may go on in his full carriere with the greateſt ſecurity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, then he may ſin with judgment, and commit all manner of wickedneſs with diſcretion.</p>
            <p>He who hath no mind to part with his luſts is eaſily perſuaded that they are invincible; nor is it very difficult to make him, who is loth to take any pains or be at any trouble for keeping of Chriſt's commands, to believe that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be kept, and that our Saviour fulfilled even his own law in our ſtead, and that we have nothing to doe but to believe that he hath done all and be thankfull.</p>
            <p>In a word, where the obſcurity of Scripture, or the difficulty of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the weakneſs of our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings have cauſed one to miſtake; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes have been drawn aſide to the moſt pernicious errours by their luſts and ſecular intereſts, and carnal deſigns, and love to gain, ſloth or ſenſuality, and by this chiefly are the ſeveral diſſenting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60424:53"/>amongſt us maintained, and do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their numbers, to wit, by level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the doctrine of Chriſtianity to mens corrupt inclinations and paſſions, whilſt we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> dare not be ſo falſe either to our own truſt or the ſouls of men, as to give them hopes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting bliſs on any other condition but that of living godlily, righteouſly and ſoberly in this preſent world; from all which follows,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That our ſecurity againſt ſuch temptations doth not conſiſt in much reading and great learning, in our skill in controverſies, or cunning in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a diſpute, or ability of diſcerning between good argument and ſophiſtry, ſo much as in an honeſt mind and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, an unfeigned deſire of knowing, and ſincere endeavour of doing the will of God. Him who is thus minded, God by his infinite goodneſs is ingaged not to ſuffer to fall into any errour of miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous effect; and as for other miſtakes wherein a good life is not concerned, God is ready to overlook and pardon what is the reſult onely of the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our preſent ſtate, beſides which,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60424:53"/>honeſty of mind, or love to vertue, is in it ſelf and its own nature our beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt being infected with any bad opinions.</p>
            <p>I am far from taking upon me to judge or condemn thoſe that were born and bred up, and have lived well under any forms of Religion different from what is eſtabliſhed amongſt us (for it is very poſſible for men to hold opinions very wicked, and yet not perceiving nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the juſt conſequences of them to live very good lives) yet this is true, that one that deſigns nothing ſo much as pleaſing God and ſaving his ſoul, and is willing to take any pains for it, and hath no by-ends to ſerve, will not deſire to be excuſed from the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his luſts, ſubduing his appetites, crucifying his fleſh, and from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of an holy life, by ſubſtituting in the room of them pilgrimages, vain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, bodily auſterities, or ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal devotions as very bad men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and be very bad ſtill. Thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which moſt advance the honour of God by laying the ſtricteſt obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on men to all manner of goodneſs he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60424:54"/>will hearken to and readily believe; but if they ſerve the ends of avarice or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, if they are apt to make men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute or licentious, lazie or preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; this alone to ſuch an one will be reaſon ſufficient utterly to reject them, let them be propounded to him with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much advantage or ſubtilty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all with this, that did I know any <hi>conſtituted Church</hi> in the world, that did teach a Religion more holy and uſefull, that delivered doctrines in themſelves more reaſonable, or in their conſequences tending more directly to the peace of Societies and the good of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular perſon, to the promoting of piety and true morality, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing of ſin and vice; that did give more forcible arguments for the one and againſt the other; that did lay grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtreſs upon a pure mind and a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life, and leſs upon voluntary ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and indifferent rites and ceremonies than we do, I would very ſoon be of that Church, and even entice all I could to it: but till ſuch an one can be found, nay ſo long as it is manifeſt that all the zealous oppoſers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do hold
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60424:54"/>opinions either deſtructive of or in their plain tendencies weakening the force of all the precepts, promiſes and threatnings contained in the Goſpel, and ſuch as if they do not encourage men to, yet at leaſt furniſh them with pleas and excuſes for their wickedneſs; I am ſure it is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt no leſs than our duty, if we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely love God and our ſouls, and have any real deſire of our own or others wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, faithfully to adhere to that Church we have the happineſs to be members of, and vigorouſly to maintain and defend it.</p>

            <p>THERE is hardly any vice that men do ſo readily condemn in others, and yet ſo eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look and excuſe in themſelves, as this of ſelf-conceit, or a fond opinion of their own great wiſedom and underſtanding. None of us can endure that another ſhould aſſume to himſelf continually to preſcribe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60424:56"/>to us, or uſurp ſo far upon us, as to be always impoſing on us his own private cuſtoms, humours or manners, as if we had no wit or judgment of our own whereby to govern and order our own affairs; and yet it is to be feared, moſt of us, who call this intolerable pride in another, are ſo deeply in love with our ſelves and our own ways, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear to cenſure and deſpiſe, to charge with folly and ignorance, all that do not believe and practiſe juſt as we our ſelves do: Every one thus in his own vain imagination preſuming himſelf wiſe and good enough to ſet a pattern and give law to all round about him.</p>
            <p>It is the obſervation of the great <hi>French</hi> Philoſopher, <hi>That the moſt equal diſtribution God hath made of any thing in this world is of judgment and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, becauſe every man is content with his own, and thinks he hath enough:</hi> and though as to the outward gifts of nature or fortune he be willing to yield to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet he doubts not but he himſelf is as far removed from a fool, hath as large a ſhare of reaſon and diſcretion, is as able to manage himſelf and his own
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60424:56"/>buſineſs as any other whatever. Whence it is that all men are apt ſo confidently to lean unto, and rely upon their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, ſo peremptorily to truſt to and follow their own judgments, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and inflexibly to adhere to their firſt choices and determinations, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and taking it in great ſnuff and dudgeon, to be taught, adviſed, check'd or controlled by any.</p>
            <p>Now this is to be <hi>wiſe in our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,</hi> againſt which the Apoſtle here in my <hi>Text</hi> cautions us; when any man hath a vaſt and undue opinion of his own powers and faculties, and thinks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above what is meet, when he will hearken to none other, nor believe any one but juſt himſelf; when he knows all things, does all things, is all things to himſelf, and within himſelf alone, not needing (at leaſt in his own big thoughts) any ones help, counſel or aſſiſtence; In ſhort, when he rates and values himſelf above his true worth, and deſpiſes others, and judges meanly of his Betters, then a man may be ſaid to be wiſe in his own conceit. Which ſelf-conceit undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly lies at the bottom, and is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60424:57"/>cauſe of all Atheiſm and ſceptical diſputes againſt Providence and Religion, of all undutifull carriage towards gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and ſuperiours, and of all thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable ſeparations and unchriſtian di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that are ſo rife amongſt us, and do ſo ſadly threaten the ruine both of our Church and State.</p>
            <p>Whereas on the other ſide, the great foundation of all true Religion and civil order, the onely effectual means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and advancing peace, real wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and truth amongſt men, is an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lowly eſteem of our ſelves, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt diffidence of our own apprehenſions, an hearty and ſerious acknowledgment of our own defects, and a willingneſs to be inſtructed, directed, ruled and governed by others who are better and wiſer than our ſelves.</p>
            <p>I ſhall at this time propound to you ſome plain inſtances, wherein this ſort of pride or ſelf-conceit doth ſhew it ſelf, particularly in matters of Religion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the folly and miſchiefs of it.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:60424:57"/>
            <p n="1">I. This ſelf-conceit ſhews it ſelf in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident and poſitive about things which we do not underſtand, and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling with affairs which do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In being obſtinate and pertinacious in ſome ſingular fancies and opinions, though upon never ſo ſlight grounds at firſt believed and entertained.</p>
            <p n="3">III. In affecting to impoſe our own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and conceits upon others, and in deſpiſing and condemning all that are not in every thing juſt of our own mind and perſuaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This ſelf-conceit appears in being confident and poſitive about things which we do not underſtand, and in intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with affairs which do not belong to us. When we reject every thing as falſe which we cannot preſently comprehend, and damn every thing, of which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily give a ſatisfactory account; when we <hi>ſpeak evil of thoſe things which we know not,</hi> as St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſays of ſome in his days; when nothing ſhall eſcape us
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60424:58"/>which we do not ſtreight arraign and bring to the bar, nor any thing paſs with us for wiſe, good or decent, but what is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to our own palate, and ſuited to our raw and unwary notions of things: when we meaſure and judge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, the counſels of heaven, the methods of Providence, the conſtitutions of our governours, the doctrines of our approved teachers, the reaſonableneſs of publick laws, the deſigns and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of other men, truth and falſhood, good and evil onely according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement or diſagreement of things with our private fancies, childiſh prejudices and raſh judgments. But more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence it is that men are apt to quarrel with God and Religion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour either to diſpute or rally them out of the world. Into this one principle, I think, may be reſolved the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, (if any ſuch there be) nay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the objections that ever were framed againſt the exiſtence of a God, and the truth and certainty of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are many things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taught and believed, which ſome pert young ſinners cannot by any means
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60424:58"/>underſtand, and therefore all of it muſt preſently be falſe.</p>
            <p>They cannot poſſibly frame a notion of a ſpirit or immaterial ſubſtance. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they think of is clothed with corporeal accidents; they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an infinite Being, nor ſolve all the difficulties about eternity, omnipreſence, omniſcience, and the like; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the whole Idea of an inviſible power,</hi> as one of the moſt conceited men in our Nation ſays, <hi>is feigned onely by the mind, or imagined from tales publickly allowed of.</hi> The Reſurrection ſeems a very unlikely and improbable ſtory. <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> It is paſt their finding out why God did not ſend Chriſt ſooner into the world, if there be no ſalvation to be had without him. It ſeemeth to them very abſurd and unworthy that the Son of God ſhould appear here in ſo mean a condition, and dye ſo ſhamefull a death. They underſtand not the reaſon of ſome of God's Laws, and think they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could make better. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the parts of this viſible world might have been much more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ordered and contrived than now
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60424:59"/>they appear to be, if all were managed and conducted by an infinite power and wiſedom: and thus rather than in any caſe doubt or ſuſpect their own want of underſtanding, they turn Atheiſts or Scepticks, and renounce the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and plaineſt truths. God ſhall not be at all, unleſs he pleaſe to be and doe juſt as his creatures would have him. Theſe now are the perſons that conceit themſelves the onely men of parts and deep reach, who will not be born down by a popular faith, who ſearch and dive into the very bottom of things, and have alone happily ſmelt out that grand cheat and juggle with which the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath been ſo long abuſed.</p>
            <p>I know not one objection or doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the being of a Deity and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence but what is thus raiſed onely by pride, and an arrogant opinion of our own underſtanding, as if nothing could be either true or reaſonable, but what is perfectly within our own ken and cogniſance. If ſuch conceited and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſons cannot apprehend the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any part of the creation; if any thing happens in the world that ſeems to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60424:59"/>them confuſed and diſordered, if their wiſedoms cannot diſcern the end, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and deſign of every thing that falls out, preſently they either charge God with folly and ill contrivance, or baniſh him out of the world, and impute all to blind fortune or inexorable deſtiny. Whereas indeed it is onely their own ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance they ought to accuſe, and others may perchance comprehend what they cavil at; nay they themſelves may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly arrive to the complete knowledge of that hereafter, which now ſeems ſo my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious to them.</p>
            <p>Let us but ſuppoſe God infinitely wiſer than we poor mortals are or can be, and that he may doe and order many things for good and great reaſons, which yet we who can ſee but a little way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but of a few things at once, are not able as yet to graſp or find out: Let us, I ſay, but ſuppoſe our underſtandings in this ſtate imperfect and limited, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of far greater improvement in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all theſe ſcruples of the Atheiſt preſently vaniſh into nothing. Thus you may obſerve with my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> that no great proficients in Philoſophy who have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60424:60"/>really improved their minds and reaſons, have ever been Atheiſts; but ſuch onely as have had a little ſmattering of it, and being puft up with a ſmall pittance of knowledge, became preſently ready to conclude they underſtood all things; and being wiſe in their own conceits, did therefore huff againſt every thing they were not able to render a reaſon of. And if you conſult the experience of theſe days you will find thoſe onely to ſwagger and hector againſt Religion who have a lofty opinion of their own learning and parts, begot and maintained by a ſlight and ſuperficial skill in Philoſophy, by a little dabling in the Mathematicks and Mechanicks, and a ſmall ſhare of wit and drollery, enough to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſcorn and compaſſion of all tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe and good men; but who art thou, O vain man, that thus exalteſt thy ſelf againſt God, and ſetteſt up thy puiſne wit and underſtanding in competition with his eternal reaſon?</p>
            <p>'Tis ſtrange that when men find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at a loſs, and utterly to ſeek about the nature of things viſible and ſenſible, about the ordinary appearances of this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60424:60"/>world; when it is eaſie for a man but of little parts to raiſe ſuch a miſt about the plaineſt truths, and invent ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and objections as ſhall puzzle the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Philoſophers handſomly to ſolve and unriddle; when men do and muſt believe ſeveral things, the cauſes of which they can onely gueſs at, nor can ever be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they are in the right; when a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone's drawing of iron, the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, the ſtriking fire out of a Flint, ſhall find mens wits employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough, nor ſhall they ever be able perfectly to ſatisfy themſelves or others about them; when they are forced in ſuch things as they ſee daily before their eyes to confeſs their ignorance, and the uncertainty of all their reaſonings: that yet, I ſay, when they come to diſcourſe of ſuch things as are plainly above their reach and capacity, being inviſible and infinite, they will believe nothing but what they can fully comprehend, and count all that abſurd which they cannot ſatisfactorily explain. This is the firſt particular inſtance of that ſort of ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which conſiſts in medling with things we do not underſtand, nor do belong to us.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:60424:61"/>
            <p n="2">2. Then alſo we meddle with things we do not underſtand, and which do not belong to us, when we take upon our ſelves to give peremptory accounts of God's providential dealings with the ſons of men, when without controll we paſs our raſh verdicts upon God's Actions, and ſit in judgment upon the various oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of this world, accuſing and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning God of arbitrary tyrannical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if every thing happen not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our minds, as we had before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand wiſhed or projected; if thoſe we love much thrive not ſo well, or if our enemies proſper more, and grow greater in this world than we would have them; when we offer to preſcribe to Providence, and teach God how he ſhould rule the world, and diſpoſe of his favours. When we dare clamour and mutiny at God's proceedings, imagining that he hath not done well, or that we our ſelves could have done better; that if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind were but committed to our care, (as the Chariot of the Sun is ſaid once to have been to <hi>Phaethon</hi>) we could order and determine things more wiſely and equally, and to better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:60424:61"/>
            <p>This is a moſt notorious piece of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance thus ſaucily to affix ſenſes and meanings on God's providences where he has given us no rule to judge by; and to interpret them according as our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, prejudice, paſſion, or ſome other vice doth ſway us; to bring arguments for any way or ſect from temporal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, or to condemn any who differ from us by reaſon of ſome calamities or unfortunate accidents that may have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen them. This ſhews us mightily conceited of our ſelves and our own judgments, when we think God ſo fond of our private and ſingular ſentiments as that all his Providences muſt needs ſerve onely to vindicate and countenance our ſide, and diſparage thoſe that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to us. This is buſily to pry into God's ſecrets, and it is the greateſt affront we can put upon him, thus unwarrantably to pronounce concerning his Actions, as if we were of his Cabinet-council, and had particular revelations of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns he carrieth on in the world. This is <hi>to exerciſe our ſelves in great matters, and ſuch as are too high for us: for what man is he that can know the counſel of God?
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60424:62"/>or who can think what the will of the Lord is? for the thoughts of mortal men are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and our devices are but uncertain. And hardly do we gueſs aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us; but the things that are in heaven who hath ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out? and God's counſel who hath known?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another inſtance of this ſort of ſelf-conceit may be in private and illiterate perſons pretending to expound the moſt difficult and obſcure places of Scripture, and to unfold and determine the moſt nice and curious queſtions in Theology. There is enough in holy Scripture plain and eaſie to employ the thoughts and lives of private Chriſtians, and yet it is too true that theſe parts of it, though they alone contain our neceſſary duty, are quite overlooked, at leaſt not near ſo much ſtudied or regarded, as thoſe that are moſt myſterious and dark: and thus even amongſt common people you will find not a few that are more poſitive and dogmatical in their interpretations of Prophecies, myſtical Speeches, and the Book of Revelations, than any ſober Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60424:62"/>that hath made the Bible his ſtudy for many years. Whether this ariſeth from the encreaſe or decay of knowledge amongſt us, I ſhall not ſtand now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but ſo it is, that many a zealous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick amongſt us ſets up for a judge of Orthodoxy; and having learnt a great deal of Scripture by rote and a few terms of art, ſhall dictate as magiſterially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the difficulteſt points in Divinity, as if he had ſate all his life long in the infallible Chair. And indeed I am apt to think this is peculiar to us in <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt that we are more notorious for it than thoſe who live in other Countries, and that not onely now in our days, but that we have been ſo in former times: for I find it amongſt the obſervations made by an <hi>Italian</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, of glorious memory, that <hi>the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England were wiſer, or at leaſt thought themſelves ſo, than the wiſeſt of other Nations: for that here the very wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſhopkeepers were able to judge of predeſtination, free-will, perſeverance, and to demonſtrate the divine right of a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elder, and were better able to raiſe and anſwer perplexed caſes of conſcience, than the moſt learned Colleges in other parts of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60424:63"/>Europe;</hi> and he concludes with this ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remark, <hi>that thoſe perſons who were moſt buſie in diſputations and controverſies, and finding out the miſtakes of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and teachers had always the leaſt of humility, mortification or the power of godlineſs.</hi> Of all the ſeveral kinds of fops that are, there is none more impertinent, troubleſome and juſtly ridiculous, than a gifted brother full of his viſions and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations, who can ſplit an hair, and ſmell out an hereſie I know not how far off, who <hi>thinking that he knoweth all things knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</hi> It is good advice therefore of the wiſe ſon of <hi>Sirach, Be not curious in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary matters, for more things are ſhewed unto thee than men underſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This ſort of ſelf-conceit which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in medling with things we do not underſtand, or do not belong to us, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in nothing more than in oppoſing our own prudence and diſcretion to the conſtitutions of our governours, and the determinations of our ſuperiours in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to publick peace and order; and a great many ſuch there are who are never ſatisfied unleſs every thing be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60424:63"/>and appointed juſt as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves think beſt and moſt fit. Hence they ſpend moſt of their time and diſcourſe in canvaſſing and deſcanting upon the actions of their ſuperiours, of which they are yet moſt incompetent judges; in taxing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt their proceeding, though never ſo far out of their ſphere and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; in finding fault with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and picking quarrels with their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and commands. What an happy world would there ſoon be, thinks ſuch a grave politician, if all things were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled according to that model, which he hath framed in his own conceit? how well would the State be ſecured, how quietly would the Church be governed, how decently would Divine Service be performed, how would all intereſts and parties be pleaſed, how ſoon would all fears and jealouſies vaniſh if he had but the management of affairs, or his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel might be heard? how ſoon would there be a thorow reformation of all that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, would the King but pleaſe to think him worthy of ſuch a place of power and authority? In ſhort, let things be well or ill adminiſtred, ſtill, if his hand be not in it, he finds matter of diſlike and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60424:64"/>complaint; or if it do chance that he hath nothing at all to object, yet he will give you a grave ſhrug or nodd, and ſhake his empty head, as if all were not well, and he knew ſome great matter which he durſt not utter. Alas! what an unhappy thing is it that ſuch a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious wiſe man ſhould be ſo little taken notice of or regarded? Thus every one almoſt conceited of his own politicks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the office of a Counſellour of State, and acteth a Prince or Biſhop, and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determineth what laws are fit to be repealed, what new ones to be made; what ceremonies in God's worſhip ought to be retained, what to be abrogated: and thus we confound and diſturb that order and ſubordination which God hath placed in the world, and render the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate's office altogether uſeleſs, and as it were dethrone and depoſe thoſe whom God hath ſet over us. It is the office of our governours to take care of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace and ſafety, and to make ſuch laws as ſhall ſeem to them moſt conducing thereto, which we are bound to ſubmit to, whether we judge them expedient or not; for if no laws or conſtitutions of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours were to take place but onely
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60424:64"/>ſuch as every one ſhould approve of, the authority of the Magiſtrate would ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing, but every man would be his own lord and maſter, which would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily introduce the greateſt diſorder and confuſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly. Hence it is men are ſo buſie and pragmatical in intermedling and interpoſing in the concerns and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs of their neighbours, or any others they have the leaſt knowledge of, putting their ſickle into every man's corn, peeping into every man's houſe, liſtening at every ones window, to furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with matter for cenſure and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and by thus thruſting themſelves into every man's buſineſs, they uſurp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due authority, they aſſume without juſt title ſuperiority and juriſdiction over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, infringe their liberty, and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly charge them with weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity to diſpatch their own affairs without their direction. The conceited man will not allow to others their ſhare of diſcretion, but monopolizes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſes all wiſedom to himſelf, and if any thing happens well with others, it was he to be ſure that gave the firſt hint and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60424:65"/>advice; but if things go otherwiſe than well, <q>why, the fool would not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, he may e'en thank himſelf for it, he would not hearken to good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</q>. Such an one is in at all things, is of all trades and profeſſions, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands all arts and ſciences, is fit to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all diſorders, make up all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, carry on all intricate deſigns, able to conquer all difficulties and remove mountains; he is ready to undertake any thing, though never ſo much above his obſervation and experience; to him all ought to repair for ſatisfaction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; he ſpeaks nothing but oracles, and to his deciſions all ought to ſubmit, and perfectly to acquieſce in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this ſhall ſuffice for this firſt ſort of ſelf-conceit, which conſiſts in medling with things we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or do not belong to us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This conceit of our own wiſedom is ſhewn in being obſtinate and pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in ſome ſingular fancies and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, though upon never ſuch ſlight grounds at firſt believed and entertained. There is none ſo apt to run into groſs miſtakes and abſurdities, nor yet ſo hard
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60424:65"/>to be made ſenſible of them, as one that overvalues his own parts and wiſedom; for he hath not patience enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and examine any thing juſtly and throughly, he counts it a diſparagement in any caſe to ſuſpend and enquire, he underſtands all things at firſt ſight, and by inſtinct; and thus if he judgeth right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he hath good fortune, but if not, if he be in errour, it is impoſſible ever to convince or reclaim him; for he is impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of all oppoſition, diſdains all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, cannot brook the leaſt contradiction, nor endure to be gainſayed; he ſcorns all inſtruction or rebuke, is galled to the quick, and takes it for an inſufferable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front if you yield not to him in every thing he ſays. It is as ſafe to give a man of honour the lie, as to diſpute what ſuch a dictatour affirms, you muſt receive all his grave and wiſe aphoriſms with a deep ſilence and profound reverence, or elſe you loſe his favour and friendſhip for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The proud man will teach all, learn of none, will not ſuffer any one beſides himſelf to have or uſe any underſtanding in his company, or to be able to doe or ſay any thing well; what hopes then of doing him any good, who ſwelled with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60424:66"/>an overweening eſteem of his own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, never ſo much as once dreams that it is poſſible he may be deceived? It is the ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 26.12. <hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own conceit, there is more hope of a fool than of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I perſuade you not to deny or doubt of any truth which indeed you know, nor to be uncertain and wavering in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of any thing which by good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reaſon is made plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto you, but onely that you would not be too paſſionately confident of what you do believe, and that you would not be ſtiff and dogmatical about ſuch things as good and wiſe men have in all ages dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered about. All I adviſe is, that we ſhould all of us throughly conſider our own ignorance, and the ſcantineſs of our faculties, and how eaſie it is for us to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and be very ready to diſtruſt our ſelves, and our own apprehenſions; that we ſhould bear a due regard and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the judgments of other men, and quietly hear and carefully attend to what is ſaid againſt any thing we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as well as to thoſe who are of our own mind; that we ſhould be willing to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60424:66"/>be taught (and untaught too what for a long time we have held as certain) by thoſe who are better and have more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding than our ſelves, eſpecially by thoſe whom God hath ſet over us, for that very end: that we ſhould weigh things without partiality or paſſion, and enquire out truth with the ſame indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence a Traveller doth his road, being concerned onely to find out the right way; and that we ſhould be ready at any time to change our opinion where we ſee good reaſon for it, and account it no ſhame to go over to the better ſide; for it is a fairer and nobler victory to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh an old inveterate prejudice or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, than in wrangling diſpute to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the moſt ſubtile adverſary. And in diſputable things, which are capable of oppoſition and reaſon on both ſides, for a man to confeſs his doubt, is a great teſtimony of a good judgment, and an excellent diſpoſition, and a preparative to ſound wiſedom; whereas to talk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently and poſitively about ſuch things, hath been always given as the ſign of a fool and illiterate perſon, of a fiery and clamorous bigot, of an ill-manner'd and conceited zealot.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:60424:67"/>
            <p>What I have ſaid of opinions may eaſily be applied to vices, where the caſe is the ſame, for it is this ſelf-conceit which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens a man in all his ſins, and makes him deaf to all good inſtructions, whilſt he thinks ſo well of himſelf, that even his very defects he accounts beauties, and can excuſe, if not commend, his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Laſtly, This conceit of our own wiſedom appears in affecting to impoſe our own humours and apprehenſions upon others, and in deſpiſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all that are not in every thing juſt of our mind and perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>I have heard not a few complain of the impoſitions that our Laws Eccleſiaſtical do lay upon their tender conſciences; but yet give me leave to ſay I never met with any man that made this complaint, but who, notwithſtanding his diſlike of the preſent conſtitution (and there never was nor ever will be one that all men ſhall like) I ſoon found would be well pleaſed if his own way were ſetled inſtead of it, and laws made to oblige all others
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60424:67"/>to the practice and obſervance of what he in his own wiſedom thinks beſt and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. And though he doth not approve of what the Magiſtrate hath appointed or commanded, yet he would have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and every one elſe approve of that, and that onely which he in his own conceit fanſies and commends.</p>
            <p>And thus every one almoſt ſets up for himſelf, and would have a Church of his own framing, a Liturgy of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, and a Government of his own deviſing: and it is impoſſible for us to be ſatisfied as long as we will ſubmit to no Tribunal, nor ever be pleaſed unleſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one be forced to believe and practiſe juſt as we our ſelves would have them.</p>
            <p>That all men ſhould be of the ſame mind, and agree in the ſame conceptions and apprehenſions of things is impoſſible, and no more to be expected in this life, than that all mens faces and complexions ſhould be alike. As long as there are ſome places of Scripture hard to be underſtood, ſeveral things pertaining to Religion which are not fundamental, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not plainly determin'd, but remain
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60424:68"/>doubtfull; as long as men have different educations, tempers, conſtitutions of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, inclinations of mind, and ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts to ſerve, as long as there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in men; in a word, as long as ignorance and confidence continue in the world, ſo long there will be diſputes and controverſies about matters of Religion, even amongſt thoſe who yet agree in the ſame faith and profeſſion. Nor hath our Chriſtianity provided any infallible way or means of ſilencing or putting an end to ſuch differences about leſs matters and ſpeculative points.</p>
            <p>We have indeed plainly propounded to us whatever is neceſſary for us to know or practiſe in order to ſalvation; and for the underſtanding of this, nothing elſe is requiſite but an honeſt mind and ſincere deſire of learning. As for other things which are not of ſo great moment, and are more obſcure, it is ſufficient that in all caſes we be modeſt and humble, teachable and governable, that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace, order and charity, and I doubt not but God will pardon the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of thoſe who are upright and well-minded.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60424:68"/>What horrible preſumption therefore is it in us to judge, deſpiſe, condemn our brethren, for thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes (if they be ſo) which God will overlook and paſs by? What deviliſh pride is this (I cannot ſpeak too earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the caſe) to endeavour like the old Tyrant, to ſtretch or cramp up every man to the proportion of my bed? to preſume that God will judge and count with men juſt by the rate and meaſure of my underſtanding, and damn every one that hath either more or leſs wit than I have, for either of theſe may be the occaſion of his differing from me. It is the greateſt oppreſſion and uſurpation imaginable to aſſault or try to overcome the reaſon of another by any thing elſe but reaſon: and this is the uncharitable ſpirit that ſo eminently diſcovers it ſelf in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which pretending to infallibility and an unerring authority over Chriſtians, condemns and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes all who will not ſubmit to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, and believe as ſhe doth. And with the ſame ſpirit many, that hate Popery enough, are too much leavened; I mean thoſe who appropriate the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous names, of the godly, people of God,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60424:69"/>orthodox Chriſtians, onely to their own paltry Sect or Conventicle, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate all that have not arrived to the ſame skill in their <hi>Dutch Divinity</hi> with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Many diviſions and ſubdiviſions there are now amongſt us, and God onely knows when they will be at an end; but if you would know from whence they ariſe, it is eaſie to tell you in the words of <hi>Solomon, onely of pride cometh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;</hi> or of St. <hi>James, Whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even from your luſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Self-conceit and ſelf-love, whatever is pretended, is the great and principal root of all our religious quarrels and debates, whilſt men too highly value their own private judgments in things doubtfull and indifferent, think meanly of the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their ſuperiours, and care not though they ſacrifice peace and charity to the promoting of any trifling opinion they happen to be fond of.</p>
            <p>I find it quoted as one of the Reverend <hi>Hooker</hi>'s ordinary ſayings, that <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60424:69"/>were not writ to beget diſputations and pride, and ſcruples and oppoſition to government, but charity, humility, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, obedience to authority, and peace to mankind; of which vertues</hi> (as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways added) <hi>no man ever repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his death-bed.</hi> And if ever unity and Chriſtian concord, and peace, and brotherly love be again recovered, and prevail again amongſt us, it muſt be by theſe means and principles.</p>
            <p>It is a vain thing to think to bring all men to one mind, but yet one would hope it not impoſſible to perſuade Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to a mean opinion of themſelves, that <hi>in lowlineſs of mind each ſhould eſteem others before himſelf,</hi> to a dutifull ſubjection to their betters in things under their charge and ordering, and to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual forbearance and charity where they cannot preſently agree, and this would doe every whit as well as if we were all of one mind.</p>
            <p>Several expedients have been propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the uniting us, and reconciling our differences; ſome are for toleration, others for comprehenſion, others for the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60424:70"/>ſtrict execution of penal laws, but alas! neither theſe nor any other are likely to have any effect upon us till we learn hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and modeſty, till pride and ſelf-conceit, and all imperious affectation of impoſing our own ſingularities upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be rooted out of the world, till we learn to ſubmit to our betters, and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things not to oppoſe our private opinions to the publick determinations of the Church. This one vertue of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would go farther towards the putting an end to all our terms of diſtinction and unchriſtian Separations, than all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or Diſputings, all the Laws and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations about the Church have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done. Whatever is the cauſe of the errour, pride is always the cauſe of the quarrel that makes the breach and forms the party.</p>
            <p>Let but all amongſt us agree together in common to mortify our pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, and conceited eſteem of our ſelves, and baſe contempt of others, and the ſimple truth will prevail in the world, or at leaſt there will be no more of theſe unchriſtian Separations and Schiſms, but peace and unity will be eſtabliſhed and ſecured amongſt us.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:60424:70"/>
            <p>To ſum up all I have ſaid. <hi>Be not wiſe in your own conceits.</hi> Affect not things above your skill and reach. Meddle not with what is beyond your capacity, or out of your ſphere; ſmall abilities and great confidence ordinarily make the moſt inconſiderable and ridiculous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in nature.</p>
            <p>Think it no diminution in ſome things to confeſs your ignorance, in all weighty buſineſs to ask for counſel and advice: truſt not too much to your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and diſcretions.</p>
            <p>Think that your Governours and Teachers may be wiſer, and know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what is for the publick good, and what is fit and decent than you can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do. Give other men leave to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand as well as you, and make not your ſelves the ſtandard of wiſedom, nor take upon your ſelves to bear down all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or to command in all companies, nor expect that every one ſhould yield to your humours, and deny their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that they may gratify yours.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60424:71"/>
            <p>Do not pertinaciouſly purſue any thing wherein you are ſingular, examine all things, even thoſe things you may have long believed to be true, with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your ſelves, and ſuſpicion of your own judgments: hear calmly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſoberly and rationally, and allow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men their turn to ſpeak, and attend to what is ſaid againſt you with as eager a deſire of learning, as you do to what is diſcourſed on your own behalf.</p>
            <p>Think how often formerly you have been deceived, and been forced to retract your errour; and that when you grow older, and get greater experience, you may chance alſo again in many things to change your mind. Be not apt to think meanly of, or ſeverely cenſure, or ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly diſdain thoſe that differ from you. <hi>Woe unto them,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Prophet, that are wiſe in their own eyes, and prudent in their own ſight.</hi> There is nothing more odious and diſtaſtfull to God or men, than the imperious domineering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting ſpirit and temper of the ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited; nor yet any greater ſport and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to his company than his grave
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60424:71"/>looks, his formal ſtiff carriage, his ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſet diſcourſe, his lofty pretences, his cunning conjectures, his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, his ſly and crafty commendations of himſelf, his wiſe remarks upon all things and perſons; and thus the fool empty of all true worth, and full of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſtruts and ſwells and admires him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but is laughed at by every body elſe.</p>
            <p>What on the other ſide is more grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and amiable, more lovely and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, than humility and modeſty, a mean eſtimation of our ſelves, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to yield and condeſcend to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? It renders us no leſs acceptable to men than to God; it hath a ſingular obligingneſs and agreeableneſs in it ſelf, though we have nothing elſe to give us advantage.</p>
            <p>To conclude all: when we had rather obey than rule, follow than lead; when we diſdain not to learn of the meaneſt, deſpiſe no body beſides our ſelves, do not think it reaſonable to magnify our ſelves above other men, but ſet a juſt value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe abilities they are endewed with,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60424:72"/>in honour preferring others before our ſelves: When every one thus minds and contents himſelf with his own buſineſs and the offices of his particular calling, contains himſelf in that rank God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath placed him in, ſtudies to act his own part well and to the life, and is moſt buſie in mending himſelf; Then, and not till then, will the times mend, and we may expect God's bleſſing upon us. But when every common Souldier thinks he can order things better than his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and leaves his own ſtation to direct his Officer, and every Captain neglects his own Company to teach and inſtruct the Commander, what can follow but mutiny and diſorder, if not utter confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? <hi>Be not wiſe in your own conceits.</hi>

            <p>Thoughts indeed are free from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or power of men, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal or diſguiſe them from all the world, we may deceive the moſt cunning and ſubtile, by ſpeaking and acting contrary to our minds; by pretending what we never mean, by promiſing what we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intend; and if we betray not our ſelves no man can find us out, and we ought to judge one of another onely by what is viſible and notorious: but yet our thoughts are abſolutely ſubject to God's authority, are under his juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who is omniſcient, who knoweth them afar off; who ſeeth not as man ſeeth, nor judgeth as man judgeth; for <hi>the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins,</hi> diſcerneth the moſt hidden wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and inward motions of our ſouls, is conſcious to all the wandrings of our fancies and imaginations, is acquainted with all our private deſigns and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and knoweth our ſecret ends and intentions, ſo that in reſpect of the divine laws and judgment, our very thoughts are as capable of being really good or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally evil as our actions.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:60424:73"/>
            <p>Now <hi>thoughts</hi> here I underſtand in the largeſt ſenſe, as comprehending all the internal acts of the mind of man, <hi>viz.</hi> not onely ſimple conceits, apprehenſions, fancies, bare pondring or muſing of any thing in our minds, but alſo all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, conſultations, purpoſes, reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deſigns, contrivances, deſires and cares of our minds as oppoſed to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal words and actions. Whatever is tranſacted wholly within our ſelves, of which none are conſcious but God and our own ſouls, I underſtand here by thoughts.</p>
            <p>But then by evil thoughts I do not mean the bare thinking of any thing that is evil, or the apprehending or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what is ſinfull; for this of it ſelf doth no more pollute or defile our ſouls, than ſeeing a loathſome ugly ſight doth hurt the eye.</p>
            <p>The Prophet indeed tells us <hi>that God is of purer eyes than to behold evil,</hi> and <hi>that he cannot look on iniquity,</hi> that is, not with the leaſt degree of complacence or approbation; he cannot endure it, nor
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60424:74"/>will he always bear it; but yet for all this, God ſeeth all the ſins that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the world; <hi>for he beholdeth miſchief and ſpite to requite it with his hand,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> tells us <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.14. and it is neceſſary when he forbids it, puniſheth it, or pardons it, that ſin muſt then be the object of the divine underſtanding in all thoſe acts that are converſant about it. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our bleſſed Saviour, though he was free from all ſin, yet when he was tempted by the Devil, no doubt had in his mind the apprehenſion of that evil he was inſtigated to by that wicked ſpirit; it was all at that inſtant repreſented to his thoughts; but ſince his will did not in the leaſt comply with or incline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, ſince the motion was rejected with infinite abhorrence and diſlike, he contracted not the leaſt guilt thereby.</p>
            <p>A bad man may often think of what is good, may entertain his mind with ſpeculations about God, his immortal ſoul, a future life, the benefits purchaſed for us by Jeſus Chriſt; may employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60424:74"/>much in the ſtudy and meditation of the Scriptures, divine and ſpiritual things, onely to exerciſe his wit, to ſatisfie his curioſity or inquiſitive humour, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelf for talk or diſpute, to appear learned, or the like; nay he may take great pleaſure in thinking of ſuch objects, and in uſing his reaſon, judgment, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or fancy about them, as other men are delighted in the ſtudy of any other ſciences or in any acquired knowledge. Yet all theſe thoughts about good things are not, in a moral reckoning, good thoughts, nor is the man at all morally the better for them, if his will do not join with nor is governed by them. If he be not pleaſed with, if he doth not entertain ſuch thoughts upon ſome other accounts, there is no more Religion or vertue in fixing his mind upon God, than there is in thinking of the Sun, or Moon, or Stars, or any propoſition in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, or any other innocent thing or notion; for thus an atheiſt may conſider much God's nature, and attributes, and providence, onely to pick a quarrel with him, or find out ſomething to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60424:75"/>
            <p>And on the other ſide the beſt men may, and ſometimes muſt, think of thoſe things that are ſinfull, how elſe ſhould they ever repent of them, beg God's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for, or reſolve againſt them? there is no reading in the holy Scriptures or any other hiſtories, wherein the evil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſpeeches of wicked men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, there is no living or converſing in the world, where ſo much evil is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day committed, without thinking of that which is ſinfull; but then in good men the thought of any ſuch thing is always with grief and deteſtation, they think of it as of a thing that is moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pernicious to them; as men think of a plague or miſchance, ſhivering at the very naming of it, and praying to God to preſerve them from it. Thus our thoughts are not to be called or counted evil onely from the object of them.</p>
            <p>Nor yet farther by evil thoughts do I underſtand any ſudden thoughts, ſtarting up in our minds before we are aware, which will not I believe be imputed to us as ſins, though if conſented to, they are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60424:75"/>undoubtedly evil; for nothing will be reckoned to us as a ſin, or puniſhed as ſuch, but what is ſome way or other vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and might have been helped or avoided. Now ſuch firſt motions of ſin (as we commonly call them) which come upon us, <hi>nobis non ſcientibus nec volentibus,</hi> without our knowledge and againſt our wills, are onely the exerciſe of our vertues when preſently checked and contradicted; but when conſented to and delighted in, they then bring forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed brings forth death.</p>
            <p>But to be more particular, I ſhall firſt of all ſhew you when our thoughts may be counted voluntary, and we are truly and juſtly anſwerable for them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, propound to you ſome of the ſeveral kinds of evil thoughts. Thirdly, lay down ſome practical rules for the due govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall ſhew when we are juſtly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for our thoughts, or when they may be reckoned voluntary; and here I ſhall onely give theſe three inſtances.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:60424:76"/>
            <p n="1">1. When evil thoughts are plainly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by any thing that was volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in us, then they are to be accounted voluntary and ſinfull. What our thoughts ſhall be depends very much upon the choice of the outward objects that we converſe moſt with in the world, and they will be ofteneſt on thoſe things which we delight moſt in, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome our ſelves moſt unto. So far forth therefore as our company, diſcourſe, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, entertainments, books, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, wine, nay I may add diet too do contribute to the ſtirring up in our minds, wanton and luſtfull, covetous or ambitious, angry or revengefull thoughts, ſo far are ſuch thoughts voluntary in us, and though they may come upon us, and ariſe in our minds without any actual conſent or command of our wills, yet we are juſtly anſwerable for them, as having by ſome wilfull act of our own diſpoſed our ſelves for ſuch thoughts.</p>
            <p>By ſenſuality, and looſeneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and indulging themſelves in bodily pleaſures, men may ſo debaſe their minds, that hardly any thoughts ſhall
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60424:76"/>offer themſelves, but what are beaſtly and lewd, or at beſt trifling and uſeleſs. Empty, light, vain, fooliſh, extravagant thoughts, are the natural product of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſloth, pride and luxury. So that, though what we ſhall think of be not at all times in our power, yet it is in our power in a very great meaſure to abſtain from thoſe things which are apt to incite evil thoughts, and miniſter fewel to them; from all incentives or provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to inordinate or filthy imaginations. And as far as we our ſelves give occaſion to the raiſing up of evil thoughts in our minds, ſo far are they voluntary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When evil thoughts proceed from groſs ſupine negligence and careleſneſs, then are we accountable for them: when we keep no guard at all over our minds and fancies, but give them free liberty wildly to rove and ramble; and let what will come into our thoughts; if they then prove vile and wicked, it is very much our own fault, and we muſt anſwer for them, becauſe we then willingly proſtitute our minds to every luſt and vanity. And when we ſet the doors wide open with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60424:77"/>any watch or guard, we muſt blame our ſelves if diſhoneſt men enter in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as well as good friends.</p>
            <p>Indeed, notwithſtanding all our care to ſecure our ſelves, thieves may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance break in upon us, or creep in unawares; whilſt we ſleep or intermit our watch, (for we cannot be always upon the guard) the enemy may ſow ſome tares, inject and dart in ſome evil thoughts. Though we keep never ſo ſtrict an eye over our ſelves, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the utmoſt to keep our ſouls pure and chaſt, yet ſometimes by ſurprize, through caſual non-attendance and inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, or the cunning and activity of our ſpiritual enemies, a baſe wicked thought may ſuddenly poſſeſs our minds, nay and abide in us for ſome time before we take notice of it; but then the mind is moſtly paſſive in this; it is raviſhed rather than voluntarily commits lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: this is our weakneſs and infirmity onely, which God is always ready to pity and pardon.</p>
            <p>Our ſouls are active and buſie, they ceaſe to be and exiſt, when they do not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60424:77"/>think of ſomething or other. Now if we do not take care to furniſh our minds continually with good and uſefull matter for our thoughts, they will ſoon find out ſomething elſe to exerciſe themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and when we let them run looſely and at random, and think at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as it happens, we then tempt the Devil to chuſe a ſubject for us, we expoſe our ſelves to the wildneſs and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of our own vain imaginations; and when we keep no watch, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der though we be overrun with ſwarms of vagrant thoughts. When therefore our evil thoughts ariſe from groſs neglect and careleſneſs, they then may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted voluntary, and charged on us as ſins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though evil thoughts may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary at the firſt ſtarting of them, being occaſioned by what we could not avoid hearing or ſeeing, or coming upon us unawares, or proceeding from the temper and habit of our bodies, or the accidental impulſes and motions of the animal ſpirits in our brains, which are the moſt immediate inſtruments the ſoul uſes in her operations; though thus the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60424:78"/>firſt riſe of evil thoughts may be involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, yet if we with pleaſure entertain and cheriſh them, if our fancies are tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled by them, if they are delightfull and gratefull to us, this implies the conſent of our wills, and they then become greatly ſinfull in us.</p>
            <p>Though we did not at firſt willingly conjure up theſe evil ſpirits, yet if we like their company, and bid them welcome, and provide lodging for them, that they may continue with us, this comes well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh to the ſame as if we had at firſt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in. Nay when ſuch enemies have invaded our minds, if we do not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe all the forces we can againſt them, put a ſudden check and ſtop to them, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with all our power to quell and root them out; we are reaſonably preſumed to be of their party, and to join with them. My meaning is plainly this, that though evil thoughts at firſt enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our leave and conſent, yet if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we knowingly indulge them, nay if we do not ſtreight upon our reflexion upon them reject them with utter hatred and indignation, and by all means ſtrive to divert our thoughts to more innocent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60424:78"/>objects, we then ſtand truly guilty of the evil and malice of them: which ſome have uſed to expreſs thus; that <hi>though we cannot hinder the birds from flying over our heads, ye we may prevent their making of neſts in our hair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſum of all I have ſaid is this: That evil thoughts are no farther ſinfull in us, than they are voluntary, or than they may be helped and avoided: whenever therefore we give manifeſt occaſion to them by allowing our ſelves in ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices as are apt to incite evil thoughts, or when we do not before-hand duely watch againſt them; or when, if they do at any time ariſe in our minds, we fail to ſtifle and cruſh them as ſoon, and as far as we are able, then they are reckoned to us as ſins, and are to be repented of as well as actual tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Having thus briefly ſhewn you when we are in fault and to be blamed if our thoughts be evil, I proceed now ſecondly to give ſome account of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kinds of evil thoughts. And here you muſt not expect that I ſhould give you a particular enumeration of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60424:79"/>ſeveral ſorts of them, for that would be an impoſſible thing; <hi>Who can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi> who can declare all the ſeveral thoughts that come into a man's mind but in one day or one hour, which yet he would bluſh to have made known to thoſe he converſes with? Our thoughts are very quick and ſudden, nimble and volatile, can wander in a moment to the utmoſt ends of the earth, can leap ſtreight from one pole to the other, are as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as the ſeveral objects of our ſenſes, and the infinitely different ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be diſpoſed, united or blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together. And if we ſhould be at a loſs for external objects to think of, the mind can eaſily frame objects to it ſelf, and a thouſand frenzies and extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and mad whimſies and giddy conceits are the monſtrous iſſues of mens brains. I ſhall therefore onely give ſome few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thoughts undoubtedly evil and ſinfull. Such are</p>
            <p n="1">1. Which I ſhall inſiſt moſt upon, the repreſenting and acting over ſins in our minds and thoughts: when we erect a ſtage in our fancies, and on it with ſtrange complacence imagine thoſe ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60424:79"/>and filthineſſes which yet we dare not, which we have not opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bring into outward act. This is by ſome called <hi>ſpeculative wickedneſs, the dreams of men awake.</hi> When we gratify our covetous impure deſires and luſts with the pictures and feigned repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe enjoyments and pleaſures and ſenſual contentments we have a mind to. Now ſuch kind of thoughts may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with reſpect to the time preſent, paſt or to come.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If we conſider theſe lewd imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations as to the preſent time, there is no ſin or wickedneſs ſo vile and heinous but a man may become truly guilty of it in the ſight of God onely by imagining it done in his mind, and taking pleaſure in ſuch a thought. Thus the revengefull perſon who perhaps hath hardly heart and courage ſo much as to handle his ſword, or to look his enemy in the face, yet in his thoughts can fight him and ſubdue him, imagine him under his power, lying at his mercy, and exerciſe all manner of ſpite and cruelty towards him, put him to extreme pain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, fanſie him undone and ruin'd, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60424:80"/>then rejoice in his own mind, that he is thus even with him; and by this means may become guilty of the ſins of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and revenge, though he hath not done his enemy the leaſt miſchief all this while.</p>
            <p>Thus again, modeſty, ſhame, fear of diſcredit, or ſome other temporal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration may prevail with a man ſo far, as that he ſhall never attempt a woman's chaſtity; but yet if in his thoughts he fanſies her preſent with him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces that image of her which is painted in his mind with a phantaſtick love; if the devil of luſt be ſtirred up in him, and he enjoys the cloud, the creature of his own brain, this is the adultery of the heart, our mind then becomes a ſtews, and is polluted and defiled; and though the actual ſin be a ſign of greater impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and more untamed luſt, yet this argues the ſame kind of wickedneſs and uncleanneſs. And this was the Doctrine of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of old: <hi>fecit quiſque, quantum voluit:</hi> every one may well be ſuppoſed to have done that which he wanted not will or mind to, but onely opportunity of doing. So <hi>Seneca, latro
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60424:80"/>eſt etiam antequam manus inquinet.</hi> He is a thief that covets, though he never rifles another man's goods, if in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination onely, he poſſeſſes them; nay a man may thus contract the guilt of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more ſins, than ever he can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly act. It is but a very little in reality that the moſt griping ravenous oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour can graſp to himſelf, or defraud other men of, but in his thoughts he may ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Empires, and plunder whole Towns and Cities. Thus a man, even whilſt in this place, may ſtal another, though in <hi>Turkey,</hi> he may raviſh every beautifull woman he ſees, rob every man he meets with, and in the twinckling of an eye (like <hi>Caligula</hi>) murther whole Societies and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>For this I take for an undoubted truth, that they who allow themſelves in evil thoughts and imaginations, who give way to their ambitious, covetous, or luſtfull fancies, are not reſtrained by the fear of God from the actual commiſſion of thoſe ſins they love to think of; it is ſome other bye conſideration, ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral reſpect that hinders them, not the ſenſe of their duty and Religion: and this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60424:81"/>I believe every one that faithfully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines his own mind will yield, that if he could as freely, and as ſafely and ſecretly commit any ſin, as he can think of it with pleaſure and delight, he ſhould not ſtick, as often as he had any inclination or temptation thereto, to doe all thoſe things he thinks of with ſo much joy. Could the angry revengefull perſon, whoſe mind boils and ferments with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpleen and rage, by a wiſh or thought, with as little danger, and as ſecure from all knowledge of other men, or the leaſt ſuſpition of being found out, kill or wound or miſchief his enemy, as he can deſire it in his mind, do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he would ſpare any of his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? could the greedy wretch as ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get the poſſeſſion of his neighbour's goods, as he can covet them, could he actually cheat and overreach, and it were no more poſſible for him to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, than it is for men to know his thoughts, I doubt not but every ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would ſoon actually invade and uſurp all thoſe things he now ſwallows in his imagination or greedy appetite onely. But farther;</p>
            <pb n="153" facs="tcp:60424:81"/>
            <p n="2">(2.) As to what is paſt, there is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and repeating over thoſe ſins in our thoughts and fancies, which we had long before committed, and perhaps, as to the external acts, quite forſaken. When we revive our ſtollen unlawfull pleaſures in our memories, and run over in our minds all the paſſages and circumſtances of our ſins long ſince committed, with a new and freſh delight; this is much the ſame as if we lived continually in them. As men often think of their dead friends, and repreſent to themſelves their features, their converſations, and divert themſelves with the remembrance of that pleaſure they once enjoyed in their good diſcourſe and company, though they have lain many years rotting in their graves: or as good men with mighty ſatisfaction reflect upon the actions of a well-ſpent life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling to their minds with great joy and tranſport, what at any time they have well done, after the ſame manner do wicked men as it were raiſe again by the witchcraft of their filthy imaginations, their paſt ſins, renew their acquaintance with them, and approbation of them. When weak and impotent, diſabled by
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60424:82"/>poverty, age, want of convenience or opportunity for the repeated commiſſion of them, they poſſeſs the ſins of their youth, and place them ever before them, chewing upon the cud, recounting over to themſelves their merry bouts, their mad pranks, their wanton dalliances, their lewd exceſſes, their wicked compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with the ſame contentment almoſt as they firſt acted or enjoyed them: and thus their ſouls ſin ſtill as much as ever, although yet as to the outward act they may be through age, poverty, want of ability or opportunity, chaſt, temperate and ſober. This is certain, we cannot be truly ſaid to have forſaken or repented of thoſe ſins, the remembrance of which is gratefull to us. To think of our evil ways with grief and ſhame, and to abhor them, is our duty; but to reliſh them in our thoughts is ſtill to approve of them, it is a ſure ſign that we have not really diſowned or renounced the ſin in our judgments, though we may have loft it for ſome accidental reaſon, and that we are ſtill very good friends with it, if we can allow our ſelves to think of it with pleaſure and delight.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:60424:82"/>
            <p n="3">(3.) If we conſider evil thoughts with reſpect to the time to come; the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative wickedneſs of mens fancies and imaginations ſhews it ſelf in the wild and extravagant ſuppoſitions they make to themſelves, feigning themſelves to be what they would fain be, and then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining in their minds what in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they would doe, how they would manage and demean themſelves. God onely knows how much time men fool away in ſuch childiſh conceits, of becoming, God knows when, great and rich and honourable; and how bravely they would then live, how they would pleaſe every appetite and humour, fulfill every deſire, have their will in all things, and enjoy perfect eaſe and content. Now this is the work of a mean idle fancy, when we thus frame to our ſelves imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary models of happineſs, creating fools paradiſes to our ſelves, building caſtles in the air, and then vainly ſtruting up and down, and ſporting our ſelves in them. What preferments and advancements, what ſucceſs and proſperous fortune do ſome men, eſpecially young men that know but little in the world, promiſe to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60424:83"/>themſelves? what jolly thoughts do ſuch falſe Romantick hopes often fill them with, how do they make their ſpirits leap and caper within them, as if the meſſenger were juſt now at the door to bring them tidings of it? how do their thoughts go out to meet that pleaſure and happineſs they ſo much deſire? how do they pleaſe themſelves with the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of thoſe mountains of gold, with thoſe ſtrange chimerical Idea's of bliſs which yet they are never like to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of? like thoſe Good-fellows the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.12. <hi>Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant:</hi> they feed and live upon the promiſes of their own hearts and thoughts before-hand, and as one hath well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed this vanity, <hi>they take up before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in their thoughts upon truſt the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they hope to enjoy, as ſpend-thrifts do their rents, or heirs their revenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come of full age to enjoy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very few men are ſatisfied with their preſent allotments, or like their preſent fortune, and therefore they ſet their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60424:83"/>on work to mend it; and pleaſe and gratify themſelves with theſe ſilly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures of their teeming fancies. <q>Well, ſays the impatient youth, when my Parents are once dead and gone to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and my time of being ſubject to Maſters, Tutours and Guardians ſhall be once happily expired, and I ſhall be free from the reſtraint of the grave and wiſe, how brisk and frolickſome ſhall I then be? how merry will the days be, how ſhort the nights, when I ſhall ſin without fear of an angry look, or a ſevere check, pleaſe onely my ſelf, give no account to any?</q> Thus his heart and mind is debauched long before his body is entred: and ſo the admirer of honour and worldly dignity cuts out for himſelf that place at Court, or that office which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects moſt, and then ſettles himſelf in all the magnificence and pomp imaginable, fanſying himſelf highly raiſed and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above other men; all his neighbours and former acquaintance crowding to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and wait on his pleaſure, and all their <hi>ſheaves bowing down to his ſheaf,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> dreamt, <hi>and the ſun, moon and ſtars ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their humble obeyſance to him.</hi> Theſe are the firſt ſort of evil thoughts, lewd or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60424:84"/>wicked, or trifling and uſeleſs imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I ſhall but juſt mention ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as</p>
            <p n="2">2. Unworthy, Atheiſtical, prophane, deſperate thoughts of God Almighty, <hi>ſaying in our hearts there is no God,</hi> either ſecretly denying there is any, or too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wiſhing there were none: queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his power and goodneſs, diſtruſting his truth or faithfulneſs: <hi>How ſhould God know? or is there knowledge in the moſt high? can he judge through the dark cloud?</hi> bidding him <hi>depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of his ways. What is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> and <hi>what profit ſhould we have, if we pray to him?</hi> what can he doe for us to recompence the trouble of his ſervice? <hi>what advantage will it be to me, if I be cleanſed from my ſin?</hi> 
               <q>Here is a deal of doe and buſtle made about Conſcience and Religion, I will e'en venture my ſelf as I ſee a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand others do; I ſhall ſcape as well as the reſt of my company or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the like.</q> God onely knows how many of us ſuffer ſuch vile thoughts as theſe to lodge in our breaſts.</p>
            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:60424:84"/>
            <p n="3">3. I might inſtance in our thinking and muſing upon things innocent and harmleſs enough in themſelves, which yet become evil becauſe of the ſeaſons of them, that is, becauſe we ſhould then be thinking of better things; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly lawfull to think of our friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, temporal concerns, but then it muſt be in due time and place: they muſt not juſtle out all other thoughts; nay we muſt wholly baniſh them our minds when we come into God's more eſpecial preſence; at our prayers, or at receiving of the Sacrament, ſuch thoughts are by no means to be admitted. I ſpeak not now of the ſudden excurſions of our thoughts, even when the mind is about the moſt ſerious employments, nor of the greater unrulineſs of our thoughts, upon ſome particular accidents or occaſions. I mean onely our groſs heedleſneſs in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to wander to the ends of the earth, whilſt in pretence and ſhew we are engaged in worſhipping that God, <hi>who is a ſpirit, and will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth.</hi> What man that now hears me would be content that all the ſeveral things not onely that have ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60424:85"/>come into his mind, but which he hath voluntarily for a conſiderable time dwelt upon and entertained his mind with during this ſhort exerciſe, ſhould be here openly expoſed to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? How many of us have been telling our money, or counting over our bags, or ſelling or buying in our ſhops, or at our games and ſports, or ordering our houſhold affairs, or converſing with diſtant friends? into how many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have ſome of us travelled? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons have we viſited? how many ſeveral affairs have we diſpatched, to ſay no worſe, ſince we firſt this day began Divine Service?</p>
            <p n="4">4 I might farther mention envious, malitious, fretting thoughts, when our ſpirits are diſquieted and vexed at the proſperity and happineſs of other men, who get the ſtart of us, and are preferred before us, becauſe they have a greater trade, or are better loved and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected than our ſelves. Or</p>
            <p n="5">5. Troubleſome anxious thoughts of future events, multiplying to our ſelves endleſs fears and ſolicitudes, diſtracting
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60424:85"/>our minds with uſeleſs unneceſſary cares for the things of this life, perplexing our ſelves about things that do not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, nor belong to us. How many who want nothing they can reaſonably deſire, render their lives ſtrangely wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and miſerable, onely by diſcontented and melancholy thoughts, and ill-boding apprehenſions? their ſouls continually ſhaking with the pannick dread of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable croſſes and misfortunes, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to themſelves great pain and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by tragical and idle jealouſies of evils to come, and by vexing at what they cannot help or avoid? or,</p>
            <p n="6">6. I might inſiſt on haughty, proud, admiring thoughts of our ſelves. How much time do many men ſpend in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſidering their own worth and excellencies? how do they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with viewing their own endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and accompliſhments, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine all others to have the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them they have of themſelves, that every one is ſpeaking of their praiſe, and that all that paſs by them take notice of them, and ask who they are.</p>
            <pb n="162" facs="tcp:60424:86"/>
            <p>I might inſtance in carking and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting thoughts, plotting and contriving for years and ages to come, as <hi>if our houſes were to continue for ever, and our dwelling places to all generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might inſtance in thoughts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and ſecurity; bidding our ſouls take their eaſe, and ſatisfy themſelves with thoſe good things we have laid up for many years.</p>
            <p>I have not time now to ſpeak of vain, unprofitable, inſignificant thoughts, when, as we ordinarily ſay, we think of nothing, that is, not any thing we can give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of; when our thoughts have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence nor coherence one upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which I may call the nonſenſe of our thoughts, they being like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of madmen, or like little boys in a School, who, as long as the Maſter is with them, all regularly keep in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, every one minding his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work, but as ſoon as his back is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are all ſtreight out of their places in diſorder and confuſion: ſuch are our thoughts when we forget to watch over
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60424:86"/>them, or command them: but this is an endleſs ſubject.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The onely thing remaining is to name to you ſome plain practical rules for the right government of our thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Rule ſhall be grounded upon the words of my <hi>Text, Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts.</hi> If they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from our <hi>hearts,</hi> then we muſt look eſpecially after <hi>them.</hi> In the words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 4.14. <hi>Waſh thy heart from wickedneſs, how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> and here our Saviour, <hi>out of the heart proceed evil thoughts.</hi> Now by heart in the Scripture phraſe is moſt ordinarily meant the affections, ſuch as love, hope, fear, joy, deſire, and the like: ſo that the plain ſenſe of this place is, that ſuch as mens affections are, ſuch as the objects are, upon which they are placed, and towards which they are moſt carried out, ſuch will their thoughts be: we ſhall certainly think moſt of thoſe things that we love moſt,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60424:87"/>that we fear moſt, that we deſire moſt. Do we not find it thus in all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? and were our affections but due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet upon divine and heavenly objects, we ſhould as conſtantly and as pleaſantly think of them, as the worldly or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man doth of his honours and riches. Were our hearts but once throughly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a ſenſe of God and goodneſs, and the things of the other world, we ſhould hardly find any room in our thoughts for meaner and inferiour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; ſuch divine and ſpiritual matters would fill our ſouls, and wholly employ and take up our minds. If we once really loved God above any preſent enjoyment or temporal contentment, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that things ſenſible ſhould exclude the thoughts of him out of our minds, or that we could paſs any conſiderable time without ſome converſe with him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him. Have we a buſineſs of ſuch infinite moment depending upon thoſe few hours that yet remain of our lives (how few God onely knows) and have we time and leiſure to ſpend whole days and weeks in unprofitable uſeleſs fancies and dreams, in the mean time forgetting the danger we are in, and the onely neceſſary work we have to doe?</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60424:87"/>
            <p>Here then muſt the foundation be laid, in ſetting our affections upon things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, in frequent conſidering the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the neceſſity, the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of our duty in order to our happineſs, till by degrees we come to a love and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of goodneſs and Religion, and then holy, pious and devout thoughts will be eaſie, free and almoſt natural to us; it is I grant it, a vain thing to perſuade you to look after your thoughts whilſt your minds are eſtranged from God; but a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed mind, a new heart,</hi> as the Scripture calls it, would produce new and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſs thoughts. As the fountain is, ſuch will the ſtreams be; <hi>where the treaſure is, there will the heart be alſo: An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit, nor can we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther figs from thorns, or grapes from thiſtles;</hi> evil thoughts, luſts, fooliſh imaginations, are the natural genuine ſpawn of a wild diſhoneſt mind. <hi>When I was a child,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, I thought as a child, I ſpake as a child, but when I became a man I put away childiſh things.</hi> As it is impoſſible for a wiſe man, after that he is arrived to years of underſtanding, and his mind is furniſhed with the knowledge of the beſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60424:88"/>and worthieſt things, to pleaſe himſelf with thoſe ſilly fancies and childiſh ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which were the entertainment and diverſion of his younger, rawer years; ſo 'tis no leſs impoſſible for any one who is deeply touched with the things of God, and hath a due ſenſe of thoſe things which are more excellent, to endure ſuch ſilly worldly extravagant thoughts as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed his ſoul, and pleaſed him in the days of his ignorance and folly. <hi>How do I love thy law,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, it is my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation day and night.</hi> This is the firſt rule, look after your heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And more particularly; Conſider what care and art wicked men uſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent good thoughts, and let us uſe the ſame diligence and endeavours to hinder evil and wicked thoughts and motions. There is no man, eſpecially that lives in any place where Religion is profeſſed, and in any tolerable credit, that can go on in a courſe of ſin without ſome regret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe; ſometimes his conſcience will find a time to ſpeak to him; the natural notions of a God and a future ſtate will ever and anon be ſtirring, and are apt to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60424:88"/>diſturb the repoſe and jollity of the moſt ſecure and hardened ſinner. Now to one reſolvedly wicked, ſuch thoughts of a judge, a future accompt, and everlaſting puniſhments, cannot but be very uneaſie and unwelcome; and therefore doth he ſtrive all that he can to ſtifle ſuch chilling thoughts in their very firſt riſe, to ſilence or drown the whiſpers of his conſcience, he would fain even run away from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he chuſes any diverſion, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or company, rather than attend to the dictates of his own mind and reaſon, is afraid of nothing ſo much as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and unemployed, leſt ſuch ghaſtly and frighting apprehenſions ſhould croud in upon him; he keeps himſelf therefore always in a hurry and heat, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other artifices endeavours to ſhut all ſuch cool and ſober thoughts out of his mind, till by often quenching the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's good ſpirit, and reſiſting the light and voice of his own conſcience, he by degrees loſes all ſenſe of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, all good principles are laid aſleep within him, and he arrives at his wiſht-for happy ſtate of ſinning without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance or interruption.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:60424:89"/>
            <p>Now if we would but uſe equal dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and watchfulneſs to prevent or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell evil thoughts, we ſhould find juſt the ſame effect, that in time our minds would become in a great meaſure free from their ſolicitations and importunity; would we but preſently reject them with the greateſt diſdain and indignation, uſe all manner of means to fix our minds on more innocent and uſefull ſubjects, avoid all occaſions, or provocations, or incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to evil thoughts, as carefully as wicked men do reading a good book or keeping of good company, we certainly ſhould find in a ſhort time our minds no longer peſtered or troubled with them, we ſhould begin to loſe all ſavour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of thoſe ſins we formerly delighted in; by their being for ſome conſiderable time kept out of our minds, there would ariſe a ſtrangeneſs between them and us, and they would become as uneaſie to us as now they are pleaſant and gratefull.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Would you prevent evil thoughts? above all things avoid idleneſs; the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men are buſie and reſtleſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they muſt be doing, and what a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60424:89"/>number of monſtrous, giddy, frothy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable conceits do daily fill our brains, merely for want of better employment? no better way therefore to prevent evil thoughts, than never to be at leiſure for them, <hi>I went by the field of the ſlothfull,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, and loe it was all grown o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with thorns and nettles,</hi> and therefore indeed thoſe are moſt of all concerned in this diſcourſe about thoughts, whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath placed in ſuch a ſtation, as that they are under no neceſſity of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any particular calling for the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a livelihood; for whom God hath provided a ſubſiſtence without their own labouring and working for it; ſuch as theſe are in manifeſt danger of conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a great part of their time in idle and unprofitable, if not lewd and wicked imaginations; having little elſe to doe, the Devil or their own vain fancies will find work for them; and when conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and argument alone are not able to drive out theſe wicked inward compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, yet buſineſs will; and therefore I know nothing more adviſable, than that we ſhould be always ſtored with fit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and ſubjects to exerciſe our thoughts upon, ſuch as are worthy of a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60424:90"/>reaſonable creature, that is endued with an immortal ſoul, that is to live for ever. Thoſe who are moſt buſie, yet have ſome little ſpaces and intervals of time in which they are not employed. Some mens bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is ſuch as though it employs their hands, and requires bodily labour, yet doth not much take up their thoughts, nor need their minds be very intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; now all ſuch ſhould conſtantly have in their minds a treaſure of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or uſefull ſubjects to think upon, that ſo they may never be at a loſs how to employ their minds; for many of our evil thoughts are owing to this, that when our time hangs upon our hands, we are to ſeek what to think of. Let us therefore every one reſolve thus with our ſelves, the firſt opportunity of leiſure I have, the firſt vacant hour, I will ſet my ſelf to conſider of ſuch or ſuch a good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and have this always in readineſs to confront and oppoſe to any wicked or evil thoughts that may ſue for entrance or admiſſion; for if we doe thus, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will always find our minds full and prepoſſeſſed; and it is an hard caſe if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the viſible nor inviſible world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God's works, nor providences, nor
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60424:90"/>word can ſupply us with matter enough for our thoughts, unleſs we feign extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant conceits, or repeat our old ſins in our minds, or tickle our ſelves with wild ſuppoſitions of things that never were, nor are ever like to be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another rule I would give is this, that we ſhould live under the due awe of God's continual preſence with us, and bear this always in our minds, that the pure and holy God, the judge of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſe impartial tribunal we muſt all ſhortly ſtand, is conſcious to every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thought and imagination that paſſes through our minds, and that he knows them altogether, that <hi>God is in us all,</hi> Epheſ. 4.6. <hi>One God and father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all;</hi> that he is preſent in the moſt inward corners and receſſes of our hearts and knows every one of thoſe things that come into our minds. Now who of us is there but muſt confeſs, that if his thoughts were all known and open to other men, if his parents, his friends, his neighbours, or enemies could have certain cognizance of them, he ſhould be infinitely more carefull about them than
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60424:91"/>he is, ſhould not allow himſelf that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedom which he now takes; ſhould be as watchfull that his thoughts ſhould appear to other men orderly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and vertuous as he is now that his words and actions may be ſuch? and while we profeſs to believe that the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Majeſty of Heaven and earth is acquainted with all our private conceits, is privy to all our wiſhes, deſires and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, obſerves and takes notice of all the motions of our minds, and that at the laſt day he will bring every ſecret thing into judgment; are we not aſhamed of ſhewing in his ſight ſuch folly, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch wickedneſs in his preſence? ſhould we bluſh and be confounded to have but a mortal man certainly know all the childiſh, vain, wanton, luſtfull thoughts that poſſeſs our minds, and is it nothing to us that the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth beholds and ſees them all? Conſider this then, O vain man, who pleaſeſt thy ſelf in thy own fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, with thinking how finely thou doſt cheat the world, by a mask of Religion and godlineſs! conſider, I ſay, that there is not an evil thought that ever thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt any pleaſure and delight in, not an
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60424:91"/>evil device or imagination of thy heart, but what is perfectly <hi>naked and open to that God with whom we have to doe.</hi> That he is with thee in the ſilent and dark night, when no other eye ſeeth thee, when thou thinkeſt thy ſelf ſafe from all diſcovery, and that thou mayſt then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely indulge thy own wicked appetites and corrupt inclinations; for <hi>the light and darkneſs are both alike unto God, he compaſſeth thy path and thy bed, he is acquainted with all thy ways.</hi> And the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conſideration of theſe things would certainly produce a mighty awe in us, and a ſuitable care not willingly to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or cheriſh any ſuch thoughts as we ſhould be aſhamed to have known to all the world, nor ever to ſuffer any other thoughts to take place or remain in our minds, than ſuch as we ſhould not bluſh to have written in our foreheads.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For the right government of your thoughts, let me recommend to you above all things ſerious devotion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially humble and hearty prayer to God Almighty. Man is compounded of two natures, a rational and ſpiritual, and a bodily; by our bodies we are joined to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60424:92"/>the viſible corporeal world, by our ſouls we are allied to the immaterial inviſible world: now as by our outward ſenſes the intercourſe and correſpondence is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between us and the corporeal world, ſo by our devotions chiefly our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is begot and kept up with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual world; when we lay aſide all thoughts of this lower world, and the concerns of this life, and apply our ſelves to the Father of ſpirits, and make our humble addreſſes to him, we then more eſpecially converſe with him as far as this ſtate will admit of; and the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and conſtantly we doe this, the more we ſhall abſtract our minds from theſe inferiour objects which are ſo apt to entangle our hearts, and take up all our thoughts, and ſhall make the things of the other world become more familiar to us; for when we betake our ſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to our prayers, we do then bid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu to all that is viſible and ſublunary, and for that time endeavour to employ our minds wholly on what relates to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life; and therefore conſequently the oftner we doe this, and the more hearty and ſerious we are in it, the more our minds will be uſed and accuſtomed to divine
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60424:92"/>thoughts and pious meditations, and weaned from preſent ſenſible objects. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very devout exerciſe conſcientiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed will ſeaſon our ſpirits, and leave a good tincture upon them, and diſpoſe us for worthy and excellent thoughts, it is like keeping of good company, a man is by degrees moulded and faſhioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome likeneſs unto them, and on the other ſide, the intermiſſion, neglect or formal and perfunctory performance of our devotion, will ſoon breed in us a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of God and heavenly things, as omitting to ſpeak of an abſent or dead friend, or neglecting to call him to our mind, by degrees wears him quite out of our thoughts and memory; ſo that you ſee a due ſenſe of God upon our minds, and of thoſe things that belong to our greateſt intereſts, is by nothing ſo well maintained as by our conſtant devotion; this is like ſeeing our friends often, or converſing with them every day, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves acquaintance with them, it che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes our love and kindneſs towards them. I end all with that excellent Collect of our Church.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:60424:93"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, all deſires known, and from whom no ſecrets are hid: cleanſe the thoughts of our hearts by the inſpiration of thy holy ſpirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnifie thy holy name, through Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Charity ſuffereth long,</hi> is not haſty to return any evil or injury we may have received from others; it makes a man pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60424:94"/>forgetfull of wrongs, and ſlow to demand ſatisfaction. He that is poſſeſſed with this excellent grace of charity will defer righting himſelf when injured, and ſeem for a great while as if he did not at all obſerve or take notice of thoſe affronts and tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aſſes, which the furious and wrathfull would be ſure ſtreight to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. He doth not lie at catch, and preſently take all advantages againſt his neighbour, and trouble him for every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle offence, and require ſtrict reparation for every petty damage he may unjuſtly ſuſtain: he doth not take all forfeitures that the rigour of the law would give him, or ſtand with his debtours for a day, or ſtreight break off friendſhip for the firſt unkindneſs; but he will for a long time bear with the failures and miſcarriages of other men, as all of us do eaſily overlook and readily forgive the miſtakes or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours of thoſe whom we entirely love; with great patience he waiteth their amendment, and ſilently tarries till of their own accord they make him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and is always willing to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to any fair terms of accommodation, and to accept of the leaſt ſubmiſſion and acknowledgment.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:60424:95"/>
            <p>Contrary to all this is the temper of thoſe whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls <hi>fierce,</hi> and <hi>Solomon, haſty of ſpirit:</hi> who when once offended breath forth nothing but utter ruine and ſlaughter, and are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſtruction of all who ſtand in their way. Thus <hi>David</hi> in that great fit of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. when diſpleaſed at <hi>Nabal</hi>'s ſurly anſwer, reſolved ſtreight to murther him and all his houſhold; and ſo the Servant in the Parable of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. who, though his Lord had forgiven him a vaſt debt of ten thouſand talents, yet after this, when he met with one of his Fellow-ſervants who owed him but an hundred pence, laid violent hands on him, took him by the throat, would not tarry one hour for his money, notwithſtanding the poor man humbly beſought him to have patience with him but for a-while, and promiſed him he would honeſtly pay him all.</p>
            <p>But a truly charitable man ſuffereth long, and forgiveth much, and dealeth with others as he hath experienced, and yet hopes God will deal with him; he giveth them time to recollect and bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60424:95"/>doth not ſoon deſpair of their growing better, but tries all the arts and methods of patience and kindneſs, and is unwilling to be brought to extremities, or to doe any thing that may ſeem harſh or rigid; and in a word, had rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an hundred than doe one evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Charity is kind,</hi>

               </gap>, gentle and courteous, eaſie to be treated with, is gratious and benign, and as far as may be, uſefull to all. Chriſtian charity doth ſweeten mens minds and ſpirits, ſmooths the ruggedneſs and unevenneſs of their natures, makes them tractable, affable, and, as far as is conſiſtent with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, complaiſant.</p>
            <p>Contrary to which is that roughneſs and ſourneſs of diſpoſition and manners which is diſtaſtfull to, and grates upon every one that falls in its way; as it was ſaid of <hi>Nabal</hi> before-mentioned, that he was <hi>ſuch a ſon of Belial, that a man could not ſpeak unto him:</hi> Such were the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> of old, grave, formal and moroſe, troubleſome and uneaſie to all who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with them, ſullen and froward. And too many ſuch there are in the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60424:96"/>world, who pretend to great and high attainments in Religion, and yet are of ſuch techy and fiery diſpoſitions, that there is no living quietly by them; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can pleaſe them, a man is afraid of having any thing to doe with them, they are of ſuch waſpiſh, quarrelſome and churliſh natures.</p>
            <p>Whereas he in whom Chriſtian charity dwells endeavours to oblige every one, and carries himſelf fairly towards all, ſo as to gain every man's good word and opinion; he is calm and mild, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his deportment, receiveth every one that addreſſeth himſelf to him with civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reſpect; his demeanour is full of compliance and condeſcention, his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and behaviour free, candid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous; and indeed there is no greater pleaſure in the world than what is to be found in the converſation of thoſe in whom the true Chriſtian temper and ſpirit rules and prevails.</p>
            <p>No one complains of ſuch an one; he is not grievous or offenſive to any, and if he cannot doe you all that courteſie you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, yet he ſo civily denies you, that you
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60424:96"/>are almoſt as much pleaſed as if he had granted your requeſt. <hi>Charity is kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Charity envieth not;</hi> the charitable man grudgeth not at another's good, doth not mutter and repine becauſe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thrives better, hath a greater trade, is of better repute, hath got a larger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or hath arrived to greater dignity and preferment than himſelf. Charity rather rejoyceth and pleaſeth it ſelf in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens doing well; it addeth to a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable man's contentment to ſee other men ſatisfied, and doth really miniſter unto, and encreaſe his own happineſs to ſee the happineſs of his neighbours and acquaintance. He findeth almoſt as much delight and complacence in their good fortune and ſucceſs as they themſelves do, thus making the happineſs of every man to become really and truly his own; it maketh him better to ſee other men in health, and refreſheth his ſpirits to ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers chearfull and pleaſed. No real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or advantage happens to any round about him, but he comes in for his ſhare, and largely partakes of it, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it becomes as truly his, as it is the perſons who is poſſeſſed of it.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60424:97"/>
            <p>Nay, as it hath been obſerved by ſome, here love hath the advantage. I enjoy greater pleaſure in my neighbour's good ſucceſs and proſperity than he himſelf can poſſibly do: for all the content and joy that his proſperity miniſters to him, I have pure and unmixt, without bearing part in thoſe cares and troubles with which it is uſually attended.</p>
            <p>Love makes us not apt to take diſguſt and pet, though God ſhould beſtow the good things of this life more liberally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome others than our ſelves, whereas the envious man would not have God doe any good turn for any perſon without his leave and approbation. He would alone engroſs and monopolize all the bleſſings of heaven and benefits of the earth, or at leaſt, if he could have his will, none ſhould partake of them but ſome private friends of his, and thoſe he hath a good opinion of. He would have God mind no one elſe in the world, nor hear any other prayers beſides his own; nay he reckons himſelf ill dealt with, and muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies againſt heaven if any thing goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him, or any one enjoys ſomething
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60424:97"/>he is without. There is many a man in the world who thinks himſelf beyond all expreſſion miſerable, for no other reaſon but onely becauſe another man is happy; the good things his neighbour enjoys eat up his fleſh, dry up his marrow, and prey upon his ſpirits, make his eyes hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, his cheeks lean, his face pale, and his bones rotten. Hence it hath been obſerved that envious men are the onely perſons to whom without form of juſtice or breach of charity we may doe harm; ſince to doe them hurt or miſchief we need onely doe good to their neighbours. Love <hi>envieth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Charity vaunteth not it ſelf,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I ſhall not diſpute the rigid meaning of the original word, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our tranſlation of it; vaunteth not it ſelf, is not inſolent and domineering, and arrogantly impoſing upon others, as if we onely were wiſe and worthy to be regarded; but it is modeſt and governa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, willing to yield, and comply, and ſubmit to the judgment of others. This vaunting, fooliſh and giddy elation of the mind is the cauſe of manifold quarrels and diſturbances in the world, when men
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60424:98"/>malapertly take upon themſelves to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to others, and fondly expect that their ſingular humour onely ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that their private will and fancy ſhould ſtand for a rule and law to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that all men ſhould accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves to their idle conceits, fond prejudices, unreaſonable cuſtomes or impertinent opinions.</p>
            <p>Charity <hi>vaunteth not it ſelf,</hi> and as it follows, <hi>is not puffed up,</hi> which is of near ſignification, and therefore may be joined with the former. Haughtineſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſneſs of mind, proceeding from a too great love and opinion of our ſelves, doth eſpecially ſhew it ſelf in deſpiſing all others. Proud perſons are ſo full of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo wrapt up in the vain contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of their own perfections, that they ſlight and deſpiſe all the world; they look upon it as a diſparagement to learn from any, they cannot bear the leaſt contradiction or oppoſition, they take upon themſelves to judge and condemn all others, and will allow none to pretend to wiſedom or underſtanding beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Any the leaſt diſreſpect or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, any failure of due obſervance and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60424:98"/>ſubmiſſion ſtreight begets a quarrel; for they think themſelves wronged, affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and unjuſtly dealt with, if every one does not value them juſt at the ſame rate they do themſelves.</p>
            <p>But now love makes us humble and lowly minded, teacheth us to value thoſe accompliſhments, to ſet a due price and eſtimate upon thoſe abilities others are endued with, and not to magnifie our ſelves, or <hi>to think of our ſelves more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than we ought to think:</hi> and therefore in Scripture, where the vertue of charity is commanded, humility is very often joined with it; <hi>Put on therefore bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind. Be ye kindly affectioned one towards another in brotherly love, in honour preferring one another, eſteeming others better than your ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we have a real kindneſs for is apt to appear to us in all circumſtances better than indeed it is, and were our minds once throughly poſſeſſed with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards others, we could not eaſily entertain any deſpicable and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible thoughts of them, but upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60424:99"/>ſhould bear a due regard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them; and if this one effect of charity did but get ground in the world, if men were humble and modeſt, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and diſtruſtfull of themſelves, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to learn, and receive inſtructions from others more learned and wiſer than themſelves, we might hope ſoon to ſee an end of thoſe unchriſtian feuds and ſchiſms which our Church is ſo miſerably infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with. But ſo long as men lean ſo much to their own underſtandings, and are ſwelled with ſuch lofty conceits of their own abilities that they think they need no inſtruction; ſo long as they are ſo fond of their own private and ſingular opinions, as that they not onely reſolve inflexibly to adhere to them themſelves, but ſeek to impoſe them upon others, and fall out with all who are not of their mind and way, nay take upon them to pronounce every one damned who is not as fond of their childiſh conceits as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are; what can we expect but <hi>ſtrife and envying, contention, confuſion and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very evil work? Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up.</hi>

We care not how we demean our ſelves towards thoſe whom we deſpiſe and ſet at nought, we can hardly vouchſafe ſuch a good look or a civil word: but now love giveth no abuſive language, never caſteth dirt in the face of any; it never endeavoureth to diſhonour or diſparage any ones per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but is reſpectfull to all however they differ from us; it can confute the errours of thoſe whom we oppoſe without any opprobrious or diſgracefull reflexions, and anſwer their arguments, and ſhew that they are in the wrong without revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their perſons, or calling them names. And it were well if this were regarded more than it is in our religious debates and controverſies; if we would learn to differ from one another in our judgments and matters of opinion without virulent rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and taunting ſpeeches, and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome beſpattering and expoſing our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,

The ill language which we give one another oftentimes doth ſet us at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and more eſtrange our minds from one another, than all our different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and judgments. Railing againſt thoſe who diſſent from us never yet made, nor is it likely ever to gain, any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or proſelyte: men are naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſuſpect that to be a bad cauſe which needs ſuch baſe and unmanly arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to uphold it; and it is a ſhrewd ſign that we want ſubſtantial reaſons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt any thing, when once we begin to ſcold and cry out with him in <hi>Lucian</hi>

            <p>Chriſtians are or ought to be ſo cloſely linked together by this bond of charity that every one ſhould be as ſolicitous and concerned for the good of other men as he is for his own.

               </gap>, which differs from what we had before, <hi>it ſuffereth long,</hi> in this that the former eſpecially reſpects revenge, but this the paſſion of anger, and though we may ſometimes upon juſt occaſions be diſpleaſed and offended, yet charity will teach us always to obſerve theſe two rules.</p>
            <p n="1">(I.) This excellent grace of charity will give us ſo much power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over our ſelves, as that we ſhall not be ſuddenly inflamed upon every
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60424:102"/>ſlight inadvertency, miſtake or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of our brother; we ſhall not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily angred upon every little and trivial occaſon. A charitable man is not nice and delicate, apt to pick quarrels, to take fire and fall out into rage and paſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every croſs accident or miſcarriage; he is eaſie in his converſe and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it is no difficult matter for a man to live with him without ever offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him. But alas! how weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent are moſt of us in this caſe? how doth every little forgetfulneſs or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of a ſervant, inferiour or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the breaking of a glaſs, the loſs of a trifle, diſcompoſe and ruffle our minds, and raiſe ſuch ſtorms and tumults in our breaſts as require a great deal of time and trouble to lay and appeaſe? we have but little kindneſs for thoſe whom we cannot at all bear with; not onely charity but even common humanity requires this at our hands, that we ſhould mutually paſs by and overlook ſuch little indiſcretions, overſights, miſtakes and inadvertencies, which we are all more or leſs ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and cannot live without.</p>
            <pb n="195" facs="tcp:60424:102"/>
            <p n="2">(II.) When we have great and juſt cauſe of anger and offence given us, yet charity ſuffereth us not to fall into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate paſſion, or to be tranſported by blind rage and fury beyond the bounds of reaſon and religion: it will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us from all paroxyſms of anger, for ſo the Greek word properly ſignifies: it will reſtrain that unruly and ungoverna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſion within its due bounds and meaſures, and keep it in ſome temper and moderation, and not ſuffer it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us into any unreaſonable and raſh actions, which end in ſhame and a bitter repentance. Our anger, how juſt ſoever, ſhould never make us hurt or injure the perſon offending. It ſhould never break out into fury, which is the ſhort madneſs of a man; we ſhould never be ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated, as to ſuffer our paſſion to hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us into any indecency or exceſs.</p>
            <p>It is certainly as lawfull on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to be angry, as it is to rejoice, grieve, pity, or exerciſe any other affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our minds: there is no paſſion implanted by God in man, but what was deſigned by our wiſe Maker for ſome
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60424:103"/>good end, and whilſt in the exerciſe thereof it is directed to that end, and kept within its due bounds and limits, ſubject unto and regulated by reaſon, the principal and imperial faculty of our ſouls, ſo far it is certainly harmleſs, nay uſefull.</p>
            <p>In truth, all the paſſions in themſelves ſimply conſidered are neither good nor evil. Love, hate, hope, fear, joy, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and the reſt, as they are parts of our nature, are things indifferent; but when they are fitly circumſtantiated and ordered, they then become morally good, and are highly beneficial to us, and ſerve many excellent purpoſes: but when they are miſplac'd or extravagant, when they command us, and are our maſters, they then become morally evil, and the moſt troubleſome things in the world both to our ſelves and others. We muſt take great care therefore to curb and bridle this paſſion of anger, to keep it under go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and not ſuffer it to dethrone our reaſon, or to hinder the free uſe of it, or to make us act any thing precipitant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unadviſedly or fooliſhly. And this I think may be given as a certain rule
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60424:103"/>whereby we may judge when our anger becomes ſinfull and vitious, and doth tranſgreſs the limits of charity; namely, when it is raiſed to ſuch an height, as that we have no perfect command over our ſelves, and cannot freely uſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our reaſons and underſtandings; when we drive on headlong, and the beaſt rides the man; when we doe we know not what, and repent of it after it is done; when our paſſion is got into the chair, and carries all before it; when our bloud boils, and our ſpirits are in a great fermentation, and we are ſo blinded with fury and rage that we know no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between friend or foe, right or wrong, but are hurried on by the torrent of an impetuous paſſion to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the greateſt outrages, to the moſt diſorderly and unſeemly actions: this is ſurely contrary to charity which <hi>is not eaſily provoked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Charity thinketh no evil:</hi> is apt and ready to put the beſt and ſaireſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon all the actions of other men. Whatever vices other men are guilty of, love, if poſſible, will find out excuſes and plead their pardon. It will be ſo far from
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60424:104"/>aggravating thoſe injuries which our neighbours may at any time have offer'd us, that it will ſet it ſelf to find out ſome charitable conſtruction or other, and be ingenious in deviſing apologies for them. It will put us in mind of the good offices they may ſometimes have done us, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up the ſeveral kindneſſes we may have formerly received from them, and make uſe of that as an argument to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us more eaſily to paſs by the wrong we now ſuffer. Love will be ſure to alledge ſomething or other in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſometimes their age, ſometimes their ignorance, ſometimes the ſickneſs of their body, ſometimes that of their mind: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was done by miſtake, perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, againſt the mind and will of him who did it. Whatever miſchief or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage we have received, yet perhaps it was never intended or deſigned, and it was done rather by chance, than out of any ill will: at leaſt he was miſinformed, he was in a great and violent paſſion, and much out of humour when he did it, and perhaps now is heartily ſorry for what he has done, and is juſt coming to ask us forgiveneſs.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:60424:104"/>
            <p>Love is not jealous or ſuſpicious, doth not endeavour to blaſt mens good actions and reputations by imagining and ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome ſecret evil or bad deſign in them, but makes a favourable conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a fair and candid interpretation of every thing, and always judgeth the beſt.</p>
            <p>I know nothing more oppoſite to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than that detracting, cenſorious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which prevails ſo much in the world: when men raſhly cenſure and condemn their neighbours without any juſt or probable grounds, and by vain ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and ill-favoured conſtructions leſſen the good they doe, and aggravate the evil; as thus, <q>Such an one is a very liberal and charitable man, and it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he doth a great deal of good in the place where he lives; but I wiſh he be not vain-glorious in all this. I am much afraid he doth it onely to be ſeen of men. Another is indeed very ſerious and devout in the Church, but I doubt whether he be as honeſt at home. I can find no fault with ſuch a neighbour, he is wholly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60424:105"/>blameleſs as to his outward converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a good moral man, but I do not queſtion but he hath ſome private haunts, he is onely a little more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cloſe than the reſt of his neighbours.</q> Thus do many men, who it may be are conſcious to themſelves that they have no true ſolid worth on which to bottom a reputation, ſeek to raiſe it on the ruine of other mens. Such as are bad themſelves are apt to think all others ſo too, and to ſuſpect that every one is an hypocrite and diſſembler, who pretends to more honeſty or religion than themſelves. They cannot imagine that others, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever outward ſhew they may make, can really abſtain from thoſe pleaſures and gratifications which they are ſo ſtrongly inclined unto, and in which they find ſo much ſavour and reliſh. But love takes every thing by the beſt handle, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver judgeth nor ſuſpecteth any man to be worſe than his viſible actions do declare him. <hi>Love thinketh no evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Charity rejoyceth not in iniquity, but in the truth.</hi> A charitable man is ſo far from rejoycing when others doe amiſs, that he is paſſionately affected with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60424:105"/>for it. He is moved to as much pity and compaſſion, and feels as ſenſible a grief for the ſins and follies of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom he dwells, as he doth for any temporal afflictions or bodily calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that do at any time befall them. He longeth for the ſalvation of all men, and nothing can trouble him more than to ſee men needleſly and fooliſhly deſtroying and undoing themſelves, when by the Religion they profeſs they enjoy ſo many and ſuch fair opportunities of making themſelves for ever happy. But he <hi>rejoyceth in the truth.</hi> Nothing pleaſeth him ſo much as to ſee goodneſs and truth prevail and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their dominions, and become proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and triumphant in the world. He joineth with the heavenly hoſt at the converſion of every ſinner in their hymns of praiſes and allelujahs, and heartily bleſſeth the divine goodneſs for thoſe graces and excellent diſpoſitions and qualities he finds others endued with.</p>
            <p>How far then are they from charity to whom it is meat and drink to hear a bad ſtory of their neighbour? who watch for mens halting, make ſport with their
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60424:106"/>ſins, and take great pleaſure and delight in publiſhing the guilt and ſhame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: who gad from houſe to houſe, and run into all companies on no other errand but to proclaim and divulge ſuch failings and imperfections as they know their neighbours are guilty of; who cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly pry into mens actions on purpoſe to ſpy out ſome faults, and then ſeverely comment and criticiſe upon them; and whereever they come, make them the ſubject of their impertinent and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury prattle. But the Apoſtle farther adds,</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Charity beareth all things.</hi> The words in the original are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which are here badly rendred. It ſhould be, as almoſt all Interpreters do agree, covereth and concealeth all things. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity chuſeth rather to hide and caſt a veil over the ſins and faults of others, than to trumpet and proclaim them. A charitable man is not wanting in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to warn and rebuke thoſe whom he knows guilty of any notorious ſins, but then he doth it ſecretly and in private: before others he chuſes rather to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what is good and commendable
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60424:106"/>in men, than of what is faulty: he never ſpeaks ill of any man behind his back, but rather if poſſible finds ſomething or other to commend him for. There is hardly any man ſo wicked, ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to baſeneſs and villany, but he hath ſome good quality or other, and this charity will be ſure to lay hold on, and improve to his advantage: not that we are bound to commend any one falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or may not ſpeak the truth of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when it is for his own or other mens advantage that it ſhould be diſcovered; but charity obligeth us to give a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character of others, and to repreſent them, as much as may be, to advantage; and to take all opportunities to commend them, rather than needleſly to vilify and diſparage them, and ſpeak all the evil we know of them.</p>
            <p>There are many who are always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the looſeneſs and prophaneneſs of the age, of the ſins and debaucheries of the times they live in, and under this pretence they grievouſly ſlander, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite and calumniate their neighbours, and take all occaſions to rip up and lay open their faults, and with great ſtudy
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60424:107"/>and artifice publiſh their diſgraces; and this they doe with great demureneſs and turned-up eyes, as if they were mightily concerned for the honour of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and were heartily troubled and grieved to hear or report ſuch ſhamefull and ſcandalous things, and thus when they have vented a moſt curſed malitious lye, with the woman in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> they wipe their mouths and ſay they have done no wickedneſs, and would have you impute it wholly to their zeal, and not to their malice. This I cannot better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto you than by tranſlating the words of an ancient Father, who thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes ſome in his days.</p>
            <p>[There are, ſaith he, who ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhadow and diſguiſe the malice and ill-will they have conceived againſt any ſort of perſons or company of men with the falſe colour of zeal for the glory of God, and ſorrow for the wickedneſs of the times; and then looking very ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and premiſing a deep ſigh, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected countenance and dolefull voice, they vent their lies and ſlanders; and therefore, ſaith he, they doe all this, that they may the more eaſily perſuade thoſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60424:107"/>who hear them of the truth of what they relate; that the ſtory may be the ſooner believed, and more readily ſwallowed, as ſeeming to be uttered with an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, and rather with the affection of one that condoles, than any fetch of malice: I am grievouſly ſorry for it, ſaith one, for I love the man well, he is one of excellent parts, and hath many things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laudable in him, but— and then he ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates this particular ſin (whether tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or falſly imputed to him it matters not) to the higheſt degree: Another tells you, I knew ſo much of him before, but it ſhould never have gone farther for me, but now ſeeing the matter is out (though perhaps he was the firſt broacher of it) he ſhakes his head and lifts up his eyes and tells you it is indeed too true; he ſpeaks it with grief of heart, and then tells it in every company he comes in, but adds it is great pity, he otherwiſe excells in many things, but in this he cannot be excuſed.] Thus far my Authour.</p>
            <p>There is, ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 12.18. that ſpeaketh like the piercings of a ſword, and <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.8. <hi>the words of a tale-bearer are as wounds, and they go down into the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60424:108"/>innermoſt parts of the belly: Curſe the whiſperer and double tongued, for ſuch have deſtroyed many that were at peace,</hi> ſaith the ſon of <hi>Syrach:</hi> This if any thing is point blank contrary to charity, for <hi>love covereth all ſins, Prov.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hideth all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Yet farther, <hi>Charity believeth all things, hopeth all things.</hi> It maketh us to believe all the good of others we have the leaſt probable ground for, and to hope that which we have no reaſon to believe. We very eaſily believe thoſe things to be, which we before-hand wiſh were true, and therefore charity being a wiſhing well to all men, muſt needs incline us to believe well alſo of them: this daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us, that where we love, there we are very unapt to diſcern faults, though never ſo plain and obvious to the impartial and diſintereſted; witneſs the ſtrange blindneſs men generally have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own, though never ſo groſs and fooliſh. The judgment of charity is very large and comprehenſive, it takes in all, and believes well of every one who continues within the pale of the Chriſtian Church, doth never preſume to judge
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60424:108"/>mens hearts, or pry into their ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
            <p>Nay, where there is ſome reaſon to doubt of a man's truth and ſincerity, yet charity <hi>hopeth</hi> the beſt. It deſpairs of no man's repentance and ſalvation, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains ſome hopes that even the worſt of men, the moſt refractory and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient will at length amend and grow wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. Whoever ſins, charity hopes it is out of weakneſs, or ſurpriſe, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and not out of wilfulneſs or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cuſtome: whoever miſtakes charity hopes the errour proceeds from ignorance onely, or unavoidable prejudice, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy education, and not from a bad and wicked mind, or from any worldly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual intereſt. And in this particular is the charity of our Church much to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, who contents her ſelf with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding an undoubted ſafe way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without paſſing any reprobating ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and anathema's on all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſocieties of profeſſours, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding them from all hope of mercy or poſſibility of ſalvation. And indeed it concerneth us all to take great care right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcharge this office of charity, ſince
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60424:109"/>according as we judge others, ſo ſhall we our ſelves be judged; it is our intereſt as well as our duty to be very mild and mercifull in our cenſures of others, and to judge of them with favour and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſince <hi>with what meaſure we meaſure unto others, it ſhall be meaſured unto us again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. Laſtly, <hi>charity endureth all things;</hi> never will be wearied or tired out; is not fickle and wavering; thinks nothing too much to doe, nothing too great to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, nothing too hard to undergo for the good of others. Love ſticks not at any thing, nay makes any duty or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour eaſie and pleaſant; as <hi>Jacob</hi> after his diſappointment grudged not to ſerve the other ſeven years for the ſake of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel. Love is ſtrong as death, many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot quench it, nor the flouds drown it;</hi> nothing can allay the heat of its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, or ſtop its progreſs; it eaſily ſurmounts all difficulties, and triumphs over all oppoſition: though we meet with great ingratitude, contradiction and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy returns from thoſe whom we have obliged, yet love is not apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the good it hath done, but ſtill
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60424:109"/>perſeveres, endeavouring to overcome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with good, unkindneſſes with courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. Love doth not invent excuſes or ſeeek delays when a fair occaſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing it ſelf is offered; it makes us willing for ſome time to leave our own buſineſs, though of near concernment to us, to expoſe our ſelves to heat and cold, to weariſome and painfull journies, to deny our ſelves our own eaſe, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and profit in ſome meaſure, rather than to forfeit an opportunity of ſhewing a great kindneſs. <hi>Charity endureth all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This now is that affection of love which we ought to bear one towards another: this is that kind, benign and gratious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which manifeſts us to be the children of God, and to partake of his nature, and to be like unto him who <hi>is good and doth good,</hi> which ſhews us to be the followers of our Saviour in deed and in truth, <hi>who went about doing good,</hi> and which alone can fit us for that Kingdom wherein true love, undiſturbed peace and univerſal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity dwells and reigns for evermore.</p>
            <p>To convince you of the neceſſity of this frame and temper of ſpirit, let me onely
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60424:110"/>put you in mind of what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the beginning of this Chap. that though a man ſhould be able <hi>to ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels,</hi> had the gift of all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and could diſcourſe with the greateſt eloquence and efficacy, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this charity he would be but as <hi>ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding braſs, or a tinkling cymbal.</hi> Though a man had the <hi>gift of prophecy,</hi> and could foretell things to come, were inſpired from above, and were able to convert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Faith, and propagate the Chriſtian Religion in the world; though he could <hi>underſtand all myſteries,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound all Scripture, and give an account of the moſt difficult and ſublime truths, and had <hi>all knowledge and all faith,</hi> nay the higheſt degree of that faith by which miracles are wrought, ſo that he could <hi>remove mountains,</hi> yet without this affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſincere love he would be nothing worth; nay though a man ſhould part with his whole eſtate, and <hi>beſtow all his goods to feed the poor,</hi> though he ſhould exerciſe the higheſt acts of bounty and liberality; nay, laſtly, though he ſhould <hi>give his body to be burned</hi> for his religion, and die a martyr for the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, yet if he hath not charity, if he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60424:110"/>cannot patiently bear and pardon injuries and affronts, if he delights not to doe good, and rejoyceth not in the happineſs of other men, if he be envious, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious and implacable, of a narrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſpirit, it profiteth him nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I onely beg your patience whilſt in a very few words I recommend this <hi>more excellent way,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, this ſpirit of love to you eſpecially who have enjoyed the advantages of a liberal and ingenuous education. And if ever I could hope to prevail and perſuade, I ſhould certainly expect no little ſucceſs in ſuch an aſſembly as this, conſiſting of perſons well taught and bred, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have been refined and poliſhed, and minds improved and cultivated, and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moulded and faſhioned by the care and skill of thoſe excellent perſons to whoſe charge we were committed.</p>
            <p>I think it ought not over-ſlightly to be taken notice of, that in ſuch an age as this, there are yet ſo many perſons of faſhion and quality who are not aſhamed to own their education, and therefore may be reaſonably thought yet ſenſible of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60424:111"/>the benefits that may have accrued to them from it. I ſay, in ſuch an age as this, wherein the firſt thing almoſt that Gentlemen affect, after they have once got free from under the diſcipline of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is preſently to forget all they have learned, and to eraſe out of their minds all the ſober counſels and uſefull rules they had before received, huffing at all inſtruction as a piece of pedantry, fit onely for children in coats, or fools, and freely revenging themſelves on their Schoolmaſters and Tutours, for attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to make them wiſe and good againſt their wills.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this, I muſt ſay, that by our thus meeting together we do but little credit either to our ſelves or the School where we were brought up, or the perſons under whoſe feet we ſate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we alſo clearly diſcover to the world in our temper and converſation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing excellent and ſingular that may diſtinguiſh us from the rude untutoured vulgar, the ignorant and illiterate rout.</p>
            <p>Were that onely good breeding which is now moſt faſhionable, and doth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60424:111"/>account paſs amongſt us for ſuch, I ſhould very freely acknowledge it a bleſſing not much to be valued or regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. To move ones leg and body grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and in time, to bow and cringe in mood and figure; to wear cloaths moſt exactly made according to the neweſt mode; to be able to ſpeak of the <hi>French</hi> Court, and to repeat the witty part of a Play, and to talk finely of love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and make ſmart reparties; and to give every one good words without meaning any thing at all by them; to know how to embroider a diſcourſe with many oaths and a little Atheiſm; to be able to drink high, and hector loudly; to abuſe a Parſon, and to dare to kill a man; theſe and ſuch others not worth naming are too often now a-days repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the onely gentile accompliſhments of a well-bred perſon?</p>
            <p>But theſe are not the things we learnt at St. <hi>Paul's School,</hi> nor is this the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we now aſſemble in God's Houſe to bleſs his name for. Thoſe are truly well bred, not onely whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and diſcerning faculties are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and inlarged, but eſpecially whoſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60424:112"/>natural rudeneſs and ſtubbornneſs is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and wild and unruly paſſions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; whoſe affections and deſires are made governable and orderly; who are become manageable and flexible, calm and tractable, willing to endure reſtraints and to live according to the beſt rules. By good education we are, as it were, made over again, the roughneſs of our natural tempers is filed off, and all their defects ſupplied; and by prudent diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, good example and wiſe counſel our manners are ſo formed, that by the benefit of an happy education we come almoſt as much to excell other men, as they do the brute beaſts that have no underſtanding.</p>
            <p>How much therefore we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to our School, we can no better way ſhew than by our civil and comely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, by our compliant and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive converſation, by our courteous and affable, ſweet and benign diſpoſition, by our kind, uſefull and ſociable behaviour in the world.</p>
            <p>If we conſult the ſober judgments of all men, we ſhall ſoon find that there is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60424:112"/>nothing renders a man more reſpected, his company more pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and deſirable, nothing procures grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter credit and reputation, and ſooner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the good word of every one, than a free, ingenuous, candid and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding temper, that ſtudies to oblige, and rejoices to doe good; That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more noble and generous than an univerſal love and good-will to all men; nothing more amiable than mildneſs, peaceableneſs and gentleneſs of ſpirit; nothing more gracefull and gentile than kindneſs and benignity; nothing more honourable and manly than being uſefull and beneficial to all round about us.</p>
            <p>And theſe are indeed qualities and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections hardly attainable (as a wiſe man expreſſes it) by thoſe <hi>who hold the plough, and glory in the goad; who drive oxen, and are occupied in their labours; and whoſe talk is of their bullocks; who give their mind to make furrows, and are diligent to give the kine fodder.</hi> Theſe are above the reach of <hi>the ſmith who ſitteth by the Anvil, and conſidereth the iron-work; the vapour of the fire waſteth his fleſh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60424:113"/>noiſe of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look ſtill upon the pattern of the thing be maketh.</hi> Vulgar and undiſciplined minds are not capable of ſuch noble principles, and worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
            <p>If we indulge our furious and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate appetites, and blind and impotent paſſions; if we are apt to pick quarrels, and delight in feuds and broils, if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our ſelves to rail and give ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; if we are rude and ſaucy in our behaviour towards others, or practiſe any of the mean arts and methods of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: we baſely unman and degrade our ſelves, and offer an affront to that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral education which hath been beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, and equal our ſelves to the vulgar rout: for where are ſuch qualities as theſe to be found but amongſt clowns and beggars, amongſt the ſavage and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred? Such accompliſhments as theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit onely hoſtlers and porters: they are moſt highly diſtaſtfull to all company, and productive of averſation and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. In a word, if you would excell others in point of true worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, endeavour to get your ſouls poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60424:113"/>with this divine grace of charity, which is the onely thing that doth truly ennoble a man, that doth exalt and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his nature, and raiſe him above the reſt of his fellow-creatures.</p>

An uneaſie bed, a broken ſleep, a ſudden affliction, an <hi>hand-writing on the wall,</hi> will ſometimes force us, whether we will or no, to ſmite upon our breaſts, and reflect ſadly upon our paſt diſhonourable miſdeeds and the ſatal iſſue of them; and very often our own conſcience will fly in our face, notwithſtanding all our arts to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it, or our charms to lull it aſleep; nor could a wicked man ever be at quiet
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60424:115"/>in his mind, but that he is reſolved by God's grace, when time ſhall ſerve, to doe ſomething or other, he doth not well know what or when, whereby he may obtain pardon for all the follies and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of his life paſt.</p>
            <p>I am very confident I now repreſent to you the ſecret mind of moſt wicked Chriſtians who at any time think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, <hi>viz.</hi> that that which makes them ſo hardy and ſtupidly neglectfull of their immortal concerns, and ſo jocund and pleaſant whilſt they live in plain known ſins, is this, that they promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and depend on God's goodneſs for time and opportunity of making amends in a lingring ſickneſs, or in a declining age. They are now young and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſtrong and luſty, their pulſe beats evenly, their bloud moves briskly, their ſpirits are active and ſubtile, and they feel no ſymptoms of any approaching ſickneſs. Hereafter therefore they think it will be time enough to look after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, when they ſhall be nigh leaving this, when their bodies ſhall begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and their ſtrength to decay, and death ſhall make its approaches.</p>
            <pb n="222" facs="tcp:60424:116"/>
            <p>Thus there are as it were two ways propounded to Heaven; one, (and that is counted a very dull, tedious and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult paſſage,) by the conſtant doing of good, by <hi>living righteouſly and godlily and ſoberly in this preſent world.</hi> The other, (which is a ſhorter cut, and a much broader way;) by repenting at our death of a wicked life: and it is not at all hard to gueſs which way the greateſt part of men will chuſe.</p>
            <p>And would this doe, it were indeed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine and ſubtile management of things: for thus we might ſwallow the bait, and never be hurt by the hook: we might have both the pleaſure of being wicked, and the hopes of being ſaved. We might ſpare our ſelves all the trouble of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and yet not miſs of the reward of it. We might ſpend all our days as we liſt, gratify every vain humour and appetite, enjoy this world as much as we can, deny our ſelves nothing that our luſts and paſſions crave, live all our life long without God in the world, and yet at laſt die in the Lord.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:60424:116"/>
            <p>The great enemy of mankind hath not in all his magazine a more deadly engine for the deſtruction of ſouls. Nor is there any thing I know of, that doth ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly fruſtrate and defeat the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our Saviour's coming into the world, and render our Chriſtianity ſo uſeleſs to us, as this one preſumption, that the whole of Religion, or all that is neceſſary to ſalvation, may be performed upon a ſick or death-bed. For if it may be done as well at the laſt, in good truth what need we trouble our ſelves about it ſooner? what need we diſquiet our ſelves in vain about the exerciſes of vertue and piety, or forego the ſweet pleaſures of this life, or conſtantly maintain a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ungratefull conflict with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and inordinate cravings of our fleſh, or renounce our ſecular intereſts, or undertake a ſharp and troubleſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whenas it is but at any time lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over our ſins, and truſting to the performances of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and we ſhall be as ſecure of Paradiſe, as if we had all our days <hi>kept a conſcience void of offence both towards God, and towards all men?</hi> and in ſo doing ſhall run no other
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60424:117"/>hazard but that of dying ſuddenly, which doth not happen to one man in five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
            <p>Eternal bliſs and happineſs is a thing of ſo very great and weighty conſideration, of ſuch vaſt moment to us, that to put off the thoughts thereof, or proviſion for it, but one day (after that we are become capable of thinking and acting like men) is certainly a very great and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indiſcretion; but for a man to give all his days to himſelf, and to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and humour, and to reſerve for God, for whoſe ſervice he was born, but one, and that the worſt and the laſt, This is ſurely madneſs beyond all meaſure.</p>
            <p>The extreme folly and danger of ſuch practices I ſhall now indeavour to evince, by ſhewing briefly theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. How little all that amounts to which can be done by a wicked man in order to the obtaining the pardon of his ſins on a ſick or death-bed.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:60424:117"/>
            <p n="2">II. How far ſhort all this comes of what the holy Scriptures require as the indiſpenſable conditions of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What ſmall hopes or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God hath any where given men to believe that he will at all abate or remit of thoſe conditions he hath propounded in the Goſpel, or accept of any thing leſs than a good life.</p>
            <p n="1">I. How little all that amounts to which can be done by a wicked man on his ſick or death-bed. Now ſome at this time can doe more, ſome leſs, according as God affords them ſpace and ability; but ordinarily the whole of a death-bed repentance is no more than a few good words and wiſhes, a ſuperficial confeſſion of ſin and wickedneſs in general, ſome broken prayers and pious expreſſions to the Miniſter, (who then ſhall be ſure to be ſent for in all haſte, however deſpiſed by the ſinner all his life-time before) and perhaps receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, (which he never thought of, nor ever would trouble himſelf about whilſt he was well and in health,) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60424:118"/>with a legacy of his ill-gotten goods to charitable uſes; and this in common eſteem is making a good Chriſtian end; and ſuch an ones condition, whatever his life hath been, is thought fair and hopefull.</p>
            <p>But I am willing in the handling of this ſubject to allow to the dying penitent all the advantages imaginable, and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his repentance in the beſt circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therefore I ſhall not inſtance in ſuch as are violently ſnatch'd and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurried out of the world in the midſt of their wickedneſs, and have hardly time ſo much as to beg mercy at God's hands; nor yet in thoſe who are taken with ſuch diſeaſes as render them unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any wiſe or rational thoughts, though this is a caſe that often happens in the world; for there is many a man who intends when he comes to die to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that is, to call to mind all his wicked ways, and to be extremely ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for them, and at laſt it proves that his ſickneſs is of that ſort as utterly to take away all his memory and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: and when he is to look back, and ſeriouſly to conſider how he has li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60424:118"/>alas! he remembers not one thing good or bad that he ever ſaid or did. He has pitched upon and fixed a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to fit himſelf for another world, and for his long home; and when that time is come, his diſtemper proves ſuch, that he knows nothing of his going, or that he is now upon his journey. And as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like a fool all his life long, ſo now when he deſigned to die very piouſly and wiſely, perhaps he dies raving mad. But I ſhall omit theſe and the like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (though indeed all thoſe who are ſo daring and intolerably ventureſome as abſolutely to reſolve to continue in all ungodlineſs till they come to die, ought reaſonably to expect that God ſhould in his juſtice cut them off without allowing them either the opportunity or means of repentance:) and inſtead thereof ſhall rather put the caſe of one who dies lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely and by degrees, who retains his memory and underſtanding to the laſt, and is able in ſome meaſure to reckon up and recount all his former wickedneſſes; and I ſhall conſider what ſuch an one can doe towards the ſecuring his everlaſting ſalvation.</p>
            <pb n="228" facs="tcp:60424:119"/>
            <p n="1">1. He may be moſt paſſionately ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for what he hath done amiſs, ſo that the remembrance of his evil ways may become very bitter and grievous to him, but yet it is hard to think for all this that his mind ſhould on a ſudden be really altered; for I ſpeak now of ſuch as have all along pleaſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted themſelves in ſin and vanity, who have fortified themſelves with all the arguments for vice and irreligion, who have cheriſhed the moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of, and hated nothing ſo much as piety and vertue; now is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of a ſudden ſuch mens judgments and opinions concerning the worth, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and goodneſs of things ſhould be ſo wonderfully changed, that they ſhould be able ſo immediately to lay aſide all their former prejudices againſt the rules of goodneſs and righteouſneſs, and to be reconciled in a moment to what they have ſo long declared open enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt? that juſt a little before they die they ſhould become as abſolutely of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, and as clearly of another perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as if they were in truth other men? It argues greater command over our ſelves
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60424:119"/>than we ſhould now find, ſhould we try the ſame thing, for a man to think, believe judge and act quite contrary to what he hath thought, believed and done for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or fifty, or ſixty years: ſo that in truth this grief and ſorrow that now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the dying penitent, is no other than that of every common malefactour who when he is ready to receive that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he hath deſerved, is then very angry and diſpleaſed with himſelf for what he hath done, and yet were he ſet free, would not ſtick, the next fair opportunity, to commit the ſame crime again that he is now condemned for; he is ſorry not that he ſinned, but that he cannot eſcape ſuffering for it; it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth him not ſo much that he hath been ſo evil, as that he fears God will prove juſt and true to his word; it wounds him to the heart to think that he can now ſin no longer, that all the pleaſure of it is paſt, and that nothing now remains but a ſad reckoning and account; but yet he could ſtill applaud himſelf in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his former extravagancies, were he ſure that God would forget them; ſo that it is no thanks to wicked men though they are mightily confounded at the ſenſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60424:120"/>of their guilt when they come to die, and ſee hell gaping before them juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devour them; thoſe fears and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that they at ſuch times feel, are very often but ſome flaſhes of thoſe flames that are juſt ready to catch hold of them; and if ſuch a ſorrow be repentance, they ſhall then ſadly repent to all eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the dying penitent proceeds ſtill farther, moſt earneſtly and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to beg God's pardon for the ſake of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> pleading his merits and ſatisfaction; <hi>what doe they but mock God,</hi> (to uſe the words of a great Scholar and Courtier) <hi>who think it enough to ask him forgiveneſs with the remainder and laſt drawing of a malitious breath? for what doe they otherwiſe, that die this kind of well dying, but ſay unto God, we beſeech thee, O Lord, that all the falſhood, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing and treacheries of our life paſt may be pleaſing to thee, and acceptable in thy ſight, that thou wilt for our ſakes (who have had no leiſure to doe any thing for thine) change thy nature, and forget to be a juſt God, that thou wouldeſt love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and oppreſſions, call ambition wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and charity fooliſhneſs; certainly,</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:60424:120"/>(as he concludes) <hi>they who depend upon ſuch prayers have either found out a new God or made one.</hi> Nay,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Should he back his prayers with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all that he hath gotten unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with charity to the poor, and forgiveneſs of all the injuries he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from other men; theſe indeed had been excellent beginnings of a new life, had they been done in time, but what vertue or praiſe can there be in reſtoring that which we cannot poſſibly detain any longer? in giving away that which we muſt neceſſarily part with? and as for pardoning injuries received, alas! what is all this when we ſpeak of wicked and unreaſonable men, who in their life time take preſent pay, immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? ſuch people talk of forgiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, whenas there is not one injury done to them that they have not a great while agoe fully returned, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind hand or due to them, in that kind; they have had the ſpite and all the pleaſure of revenge already, and now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they would freely forgive and die in charity.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:60424:121"/>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, The utmoſt and greateſt thing that the ſick or dying ſinner can doe is to make ſtrong, and as to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meaning, moſt ſincere reſolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his former evil courſes, and for walking in all vertue and godlineſs, ſhould God continue his life; and this is that which men uſually truſt unto in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, they hope God will accept of the will for the deed, and that ſuch unfeigned reſolutions ſhall paſs for repentance.</p>
            <p>Now here I would deſire you ſeriouſly to conſider, that there is nothing in the world more eaſie than to reſolve well, eſpecially when we are under any fear or fright, that there is not any thing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficult or ungratefull, or even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that men will not readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to perform if thereby they may but deliver themſelves from a preſſing and imminent danger; for our minds being then wholly prepoſſeſt with the great ſenſe of the danger we are in, we weigh not at all the difficulties or inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of what at ſuch a time we undertake or engage our ſelves to doe; but yet how hard do we by daily experience find
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60424:121"/>it to keep cloſe and conſtant to thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious reſolutions which we make even in the time of our health and vigour, and that upon the moſt ſerious delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And how many have we known in the world, who when they lay on their ſick beds, and were under the fears and apprehenſions of death have by the moſt ſolemn vows, and thoſe no doubt as to the preſent ſenſe of their minds, ſincere, obliged themſelves to walk in better ways, and profeſſed that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to live for no other end but onely to teſtifie the reality of their intentions by their future obedience; who yet, as ſoon as ever they have been reſtored to health, have preſently <hi>returned like the dog to the vomit, or the ſow to the wallowing in the mire?</hi> Then is the time of making good and laſting reſolutions of living well, when we can examine indifferently, and determine impartially, when our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are good, and our paſſions are quiet; but all the purpoſes of ſick men are moſt commonly like the vows of a mariner in a great tempeſt, which vaniſh away and are forgotten upon the clearing of the Skie and altering of the weather; their mind changes with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60424:122"/>their bloud, and varies with their pulſe, and all their good purpoſes are purged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the dregs of their diſtemper. And thus it is eaſie to obſerve that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man's reſolutions are juſt according to the degrees of danger that he is in; ſo long as there are brisk hopes of recovery, his intentions of amendment are weak and ſlender, but as death comes nigher and nigher, his reſolutions increaſe and get ſtrength, and when at laſt he ſees it is very unlikely he ſhould live any longer, then he reſolves ſoundly and ſtoutly to live better; the plain meaning of which is this, he promiſes and vows to doe that which according to his own fears and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is impoſſible to be done; and can we think that God will accept of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (let it be never ſo ſincere) of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well, which is founded upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration or motive but onely this, that I verily believe my life is now all done? a reſolution that is ſo far from being likely to hold, that it is moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable it ſhould not; for if I once am likely to live longer, the reaſons why I thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved do then ceaſe, and I may upon as good grounds, and with as great ſecurity as ever go on in my former ſins.</p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:60424:122"/>
            <p>But farther, the dying man reſolves to leave all his ſins, but, alas, they are not ſo eaſily parted with! he hath entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cheriſhed them for a long time, and they are not now ſo quickly to be rooted out; for it takes even good men many months and years, a great part of their time ſpent in moſt hearty and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent begging the divine aſſiſtance, and in calling together all the arguments ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and uſing their utmoſt ſtrength of mind to conquer and ſubdue but ſome one unreaſonable paſſion or deſire; and wicked men in their life time complain enough of the difficulty of this; what more common with them than to ſay that it is impoſſible to reſiſt the allurements of good company, or the charms of beauty, or the temptations of gain and honour? nay, do they not often try to excuſe themſelves in many ſins, by pleading that they are ſo uſed to them that they cannot poſſibly leave them? as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that they ſwear before ever they think of it, that they can't keep down their paſſion when provoked, that they have tried to break off ſome lewd cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and have prevailed for a while,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60424:123"/>but that then they have returned upon them with greater violence, and yet now when they come to die how eaſie is all this? a good reſolution and a few pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall doe all this great work in a trice, and an hour or a day ſhall vanquiſh all ſin in general, and at once, ſo as that the man ſhall become fitted to ſtand before God.</p>
            <p>When therefore men make ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of amendment, they reſolve they know not what, for it is a work of great time and patience, it requires long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, aſſiduous watchfulneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence, to extirpate thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate habits which by a long wicked life we have contracted, and to mortifie thoſe luſts that have been ſo long uſed to tyrannize and domineer over us; this muſt be done by degrees and ſucceſſively, by firſt conquering one vice, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; there is very little truſt or heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be given to ſuch haſty reſolves, violently extorted from us by a great and preſent fear; and after all let them be never ſo honeſt and ſtrong, yet ſtill there is a great difference between doing a thing, and onely reſolving in our minds
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60424:123"/>to doe it, and why ſhould that be thought ſufficient to ſave us at the laſt gaſp, which all grant is not ſufficient to put us into a ſtate of ſalvation whilſt we continue well and in health? But wiſhes and purpoſes made in the time of our life and ſtrength do not alone make a bad man good, why then ſhould they alone be ſufficient on our death-bed? in a word, a man that profeſſeth himſelf a ſcholar, but who hath ſpent all his days in idleneſs, and made no improvement of his mind or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and onely at laſt reſolves to ſtudy hard, ſhould God ſpare his life, may as well and properly be ſaid to have died a learned man, as one who being by profeſſion Chriſt's diſciple hath lived wickedly and unworthily all his days, and onely at laſt juſt before he dies reſolves to amend his life, can ever on that account be thought to have paſſed out of this world a good Chriſtian. Which leads me to the ſecond thing.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider how far ſhort all this comes of what the holy Scriptures require as the indiſpenſable conditions of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for ſhould all this that I have now rehearſed, and whatever elſe can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60424:124"/>to it which a wicked man may doe upon his death-bed, ſhould it all amount to repentance, yet where in the mean time is obedience to all the laws of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>As for thoſe indeed who in the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their heart have done God's will, their repentance ſhall be accepted for what they have fallen ſhort in, or thoſe few things they have miſcarried and tranſgreſſed in, and which the beſt of us all have need to lament over; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that a ſhort repentance at laſt was ever intended to anſwer for an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal diſobedience and a whole life of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; for repentance from dead works and reſolutions of a godly life, are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a preparative for Chriſtianity, and are therefore accounted neceſſary in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult perſons even before their Baptiſm; but then by our Chriſtian profeſſion, which we take upon us in Baptiſm, we are obliged to more, <hi>viz.</hi> to a new life and all manner of purity and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore to hope to be happy in another world without living well here is againſt our own very bargain, and that agreement and covenant which we made
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60424:124"/>with God in our baptiſm, wherein we expreſly promiſed to walk in God's holy Commandments all our days: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this keeping God's commands muſt be as neceſſary for the obtaining the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as ſorrow for, or forſaking of our ſins.</p>
            <p>This I ſhall illuſtrate briefly thus. The ways of vertue and righteouſneſs, and of ſin and wickedneſs, are not like two roads that lie nigh or parallel one to the other, ſo that with eaſe, and in a little time, a man may ſtep out of one into the other; but they are perfectly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and directly contrary to each other. Suppoſe that a man for a great reward be obliged in one day, between Sun-riſing and Sun-ſetting, to travel ſo many miles Northward, and moreover by a ſolemn oath (as all Chriſtians are to the practice of Chriſtianity) engaged to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it; but that the man freely preſuming he hath time enough to doe this in, doth not ſet out at the firſt riſing of the Sun, but loiters and trifles away all his time; nay, not onely ſo, but that for his pleaſure, or ſome little convenience, he travels the quite contrary way, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60424:125"/>goes Southward; and finding that road very ſmooth, broad, and full of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and diverſion, is by any little tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions drill'd on ſtill farther in it, wholly forgetting his bargain; till on a ſudden the Sun is juſt ready to ſet, night comes on a-pace, and then the wretch begins to conſider how much he is out of his way, and finds himſelf weary and tired, and unfit for travel, and curſeth his own folly, and promiſeth if he were to begin again, he would go directly to the place commanded, but by that time he hath thus reſolved, the Sun is ſet, ſhall this man now obtain the promiſed reward? Alas! before he can challenge that, he muſt firſt return back all the way he hath gone, even to the point from whence he firſt ſet out, and alſo after that will have his whole days journey ſtill to go, and all that task to doe which he at firſt engaged himſelf to perform; ſo a wicked man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death-bed is not onely to unravel all his former works, to break off all his lewd cuſtoms, to mortify all his fooliſh paſſions and unruly luſts, to forſake all his deadly ſins, and to repent of his paſt ill-ſpent life, but he is then to live a new life, he is then to accuſtome himſelf to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60424:125"/>the practice of goodneſs, and to make it habitual to him; his mind is then to be furniſhed with all Chriſtian vertues and graces, he hath his whole race ſtill to run, and his ſalvation ſtill to work out; and is the leaſt part of this poſſible to be done on a languiſhing bed of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
            <p>Had we made Religion the buſineſs of our whole lives, and in every thing exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed our ſelves to keep a conſcience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable; yet at ſuch a time, when we come to die, we ſhould find work and duty enough to employ us to the utmoſt: To manage our ſelves well and decently and as becomes Chriſtians in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, patiently to bear our affliction, chearfully to ſubmit to God's will, to beg pardon of our manifold failings and miſcarriages, readily to leave this world, and all that is dear to us in it, at his call: theſe and many other are the exerciſes of a Chriſtian on the bed of ſickneſs. And how few are there in thoſe agonies that are able to bear up with any tolerable manhood or courage? and therefore we do not ordinarily account him a wiſe man that will leave ſo much as his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60424:126"/>worldly affairs then to be ſetled. How then, beſides taking care of all theſe things at a time, when our very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural powers and faculties are diſabled, when our bodies are full of pain, and our minds full of diſtractions and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhall we be able alſo to doe all that work, for which our whole life is little enough, and for which alone we were born into this world? and this the Devil ſubtilly foreſees, that if he can but prevail with men to put off the care of Religion till a ſick bed, he ſhall find othergeſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for them then. He will not fail to be preſent at ſuch an opportunity; and as before in their life-time he told them it was too ſoon, ſo now he will himſelf ſuggeſt to them that it is too late to repent and turn to God.</p>
            <p>Ye therefore that are apt to defer your repentance till a death-bed, condeſcend ſometimes to viſit your ſick neighbours and friends: look on their condition when they lie on their dying bed; and by it judge whether that be a fit time to doe ſo great a work in; ſee how troubled and diſturbed their thoughts are, how uneaſie and diſtempered their minds are as well
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60424:126"/>as their bodies, how faſt their reaſon and underſtanding decays, how their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are loſt, and their ſenſes fail them, and they cannot in the leaſt help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Is this a time, ſay then, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for eternity, to vanquiſh all ſin, and to obtain all grace? is this the fitteſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity we can chuſe, to make our peace with God in, to ſue out our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and to perform all thoſe duties of piety, mercy, juſtice and charity that we were before wanting in; or rather are not they then happy, who at ſuch a time have nothing elſe to doe but to die? would you but take the opinion of thoſe who are themſelves in this condition, and be moved by their judgments, they will all give their ſuffrages for what I have been now proving. Do not they when ſurprized by death offer all their goods and ſubſtance that they have ſo long and vainly laboured and toiled for, for ſome longer time, for a little truce and reſpite? what are they not willing to give, on condition that God would <hi>ſpare</hi> them yet <hi>a little while before they go hence, and be no more ſeen?</hi> Did you ever hear of any dying penitent that did not a thouſand times wiſh he had begun ſooner? and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60424:127"/>how earneſtly do ſuch warn every one by their example to take heed of truſting to a death-bed repentance? If therefore he that hath ſerved the luſts of the fleſh, and done his own will during a long ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious life can, for any thing a dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can doe, be in any ſenſe ſaid to have lived ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, then may he be ſure of ſalvation: if we walk according to this rule, then ſhall peace be upon us, but how can a man ſow to the fleſh, and reap to the ſpirit? ſerve the Devil all his life long, and be crowned by God at his death? but</p>
            <p n="3">III. The laſt thing to be conſidered was, what hopes or encouragement God hath given us to believe that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or abate of thoſe conditions of a good life which are propounded to us in the Goſpel. And indeed there is very little to be found either of promiſe or example in Scripture to be a ſufficient ground of belief that he will ordinarily accept of a death-bed repentance; for are not the conditions of ſalvation the ſame to perſons ſick and dying, as they are to men alive and in health? Are they not both under the ſame covenant, and is not the ſame
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60424:127"/>actual obedience required of all under equal penalties? or can we think that any man ſhall fare better, and come off upon eaſier terms; or that God will deal more mildly and gently with him, and accept of leſs from him onely becauſe he hath been ſo hardy and bold as to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſin, and to put off his duty towards God even to the very laſt minute of his life?</p>
            <p>But however there are two inſtances commonly mentioned in favour of a death-bed repentance. The firſt is that of the <hi>labourers,</hi> in our Saviour's Parable, <hi>that came into the vineyard at the eleventh hour, and yet received equal wages with thoſe that came in at the firſt, and had born the heat of the day.</hi> But it is here to be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe <hi>labourers</hi> who came in ſo late, yet came in as ſoon as ever they were called and invited; for they gave this reaſon why they had ſtood ſo long there idle, <hi>becauſe no man hath hired us,</hi> Had they been often ſolicited by the Maſter, or his Servants, and offered work, and all the day refuſed, and onely
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60424:128"/>then at laſt, juſt in the cloſe of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, been willing to have taken upon themſelves the ſervice when it was over, this had been ſomething like the caſe I have been now ſpeaking of, of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> all their lives long rejecting <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s yoke, but juſt when they are ſummoned to give an account, willing to ſubmit their necks to it. But this Parable rather repreſents the caſe of an <hi>Heathen man</hi> that never heard of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his Religion till a little before his death; whoſe coming into the Church ſo late ſhall not therefore hinder his receiving a full reward. But this is by no means the condition of thoſe who have made a covenant with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in baptiſm, and after they have moſt notoriouſly failed of what they promiſed, do then onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their ſervice <hi>when the night is come, in which no man can work.</hi> He that came in at the eleventh hour was under no engagement to work any ſooner, he had no-where promiſed it, nor had the Maſter commanded it, and therefore he was without fault.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that came in at the eleventh hour did yet work one hour, that was indeed but a ſhort time, yet however ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60424:128"/>to render his caſe very different from that man's, who comes in but at the twelfth; which is the caſe of the death-bed penitent.</p>
            <p>The other inſtance often named in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a death-bed repentance, is that of one of the Thieves on the Croſs, a paſſage in the Goſpel, remembred better, and ſtudied more by wicked men, than any other ſtory whatever, though the whole of it was ſo very miraculous and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that the like never can be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again, unleſs our bleſſed Lord ſhould once more deſcend from Heaven, and ſuffer here amongſt us, and one of us ſhould happen to die in company with him; and then indeed from ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull repentance and faith as his was, we might hope for the like ſucceſs and acceptance. But this example affords but little comfort to thoſe who have for many years profeſſed the Religion of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and yet deferred the practice of it till the day of their death.</p>
            <p>But, you'll ſay then, is there no hopes? is there no remedy? what muſt a wicked man doe in ſuch a condition, when he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60424:129"/>happens to be thus ſurpriſed by death? I am far from taking upon me to limit and confine the mercies of God Almighty, they are <hi>over all his works,</hi> and are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite as himſelf, ſuch perſons therefore as have ſpent their days in luxury and profaneneſs, and contempt of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but at laſt humbly beg pardon, and heartily promiſe and reſolve amendment, we muſt leave to his goodneſs, and pity, and gratious compaſſion, who though he ties us up to rules, yet is not himſelf bound by them, and who may doe more for us than he hath any where promiſed, and therefore perſons in ſuch circumſtances ought to be encouraged and quioſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed to doe all that they can, and at laſt to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to God's good pleaſure, and all that we can tell ſuch men is, that the greater and more remarkable their repentance is, the more hopes of their forgiveneſs; that ſometimes there have appeared now and then ſome illuſtrious inſtances of the power of God's grace and ſpirit, men who have been as famous for their ſignal repentance as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for their profaneneſs and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and that where God gives ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary grace in this life, it is to be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60424:129"/>hoped he will ſhew extraordinary favour in the other; ſo that if ſuch men may be ſaved, it is nevertheleſs by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, not by the ordinary rule of judgment; it is we know not how.</p>
            <p>But yet leſt men ſhould from hence preſume to defer their repentance, thus much muſt, I think, and ought to be ſaid on the other ſide, that God hath no where expreſly declared that he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of all our ſorrows, and ſubmiſſions, and tears, and promiſes, and reſolutions made on a death-bed; that all theſe do not amount to what is the plain conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the covenant of grace, that though what God may doe is not for us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, yet he hath plainly enough told us what we are to doe, and that it is the greateſt madneſs in the world to run ſo great an hazard as that we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without a diſpenſation from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rule; had a wiſe man an hundred ſouls he would not venture one of them on ſuch uncertainties, and thus the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers have determined this queſtion, <hi>Do I ſay</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine) ſuch an one ſhall be damned? I dare not. Do I ſay he ſhall be ſaved? I cannot. What ſay I
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60424:130"/>then? will you free your ſelf from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in this matter? Repent now whilſt you are in health; forſake your ſins whilſt you are able to commit them, and then you are ſure of pardon.</hi> There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed another Church in the world that can teach men how to be ſaved on a death-bed even without repentance, which hath found out ways to make it not onely poſſible, but very eaſie, for any ungodly wretch to ſecure himſelf from Hell at length when he comes to die by leſs than half an hours work; but <hi>we have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> nor dare we be ſo falſe to our truſt, or to the ſouls of men, as to give them certain aſſurance of everlaſting life, on any other terms than a conſtant, habitual obedience to the laws of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. The onely certain way to die well is to live well.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall I go about to determine how much of our life muſt be ſpent in the practice of righteouſneſs and goodneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be ſaid to have lived well; ſince this varies according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of men which are infinite: this is as if a man ſhould ask how long it will be before a fool can become wiſe, or an
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60424:130"/>unlearned man a ſcholar, which differs according to the capacity of the man, his induſtry and opportunity, and God's bleſſing; but onely thus much, I think, may ſafely be ſaid, that ſo much time of our life is neceſſary to be ſpent in the practice of goodneſs, as that we may from the temper of our minds and the courſe of our actions be truly denominated, holy, humble, pure, meek, patient, juſt, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, lovers of God and men; for the Goſpel promiſeth not eternal life and glory to any but to perſons ſo and ſo qualified, and it is undoubted that a few pious wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, prayers and purpoſes, or a good will made at our death will not ſuffice to denominate us ſuch. God doth not juſt watch how men die, but he will judge every man according to his works, and the deeds he hath done in the fleſh; and thoſe diſpoſitions we have nouriſhed, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and delighted in all our life will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and attend us to another world; and an evil nature, however loth we are to it, or ſorry for it, will ſink us down into the deepeſt Hell.</p>
            <pb n="252" facs="tcp:60424:131"/>
            <p>To conclude all, the uſe we are to make of all I have now ſaid, is not to judge or cenſure others whoſe lives we may have been acquainted with, and whoſe condition according to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine may ſeem ſad and deplorable, ſuch we are to pity and pray for, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our charity upon, and leave to God's mercy; but that we ſhould all now reſolve not to defer the doing of the leaſt thing that we could wiſh done in order to the ſalvation of our ſouls, to a ſick or death-bed, but that to day, even whilſt it is called to day, we depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and not be always beginning to live; we ought not to loſe ſo much time as it would take to deliberate about this matter, for there is no room for conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation here; he would be next to mad that ſhould ſeriouſly adviſe whether he ſhould be for ever happy or for ever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</p>
            <p>Let us all endeavour therefore ſo to live now as we ſhall wiſh we had done when we come to lie upon our death-beds, or as we ſhall then reſolve to live, in caſe God ſhould continue our life to us,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60424:131"/>let us purſue thoſe things now, which we ſhall be able to think of and reflect upon with pleaſure when we come to die, and preſently forſake all thoſe things the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of which at that time will be bitter to us; let us now whilſt we are well and in health cheriſh the ſame thoughts and apprehenſions of things, that we ſhall have when we are ſick and dying; let us now deſpiſe this world as much, and think as ill of ſin, and as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly of God and eternity as we ſhall then do, for this is the great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the righteous man that every one deſires to die his death, that at laſt all men are of his mind and perſuaſion, and would chuſe his condition; <hi>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I end all with thoſe words of the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach. Learn before thou ſpeak, and uſe phyſick or ever thou be ſick; before judgment examine thy ſelf, and in the day of viſitation thou ſhalt find mercy. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelf before thou be ſick, and in the time of ſins ſhew repentance. Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vows in due time, and defer not untill death to be juſtified.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60424:132"/>Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put it not off from day to day; for ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy ſecurity thou ſhalt be deſtroyed, and periſh in the day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</hi>

            <p>FOR our more clearly underſtanding the ſenſe and extent of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of our bleſſed Saviour's, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> theſe two things muſt be obſerved.</p>
            <pb n="256" facs="tcp:60424:133"/>
            <p n="1">I. That it was a common practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſwear by ſome of God's creatures, which cuſtome prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amongſt them from a pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of God's holy name: whenever they would affirm any thing with more than ordinary vehemence and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or beget an aſſurance of what they ſaid in another, they thought it not fit or decent preſently to invoke the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign God of Heaven and earth, and on every ſlight and trivial occaſion to run to the great maker and father of all things; but in ſmaller matters and in ordinary talk they would ſwear by their <hi>Parents,</hi> by the <hi>Heavens,</hi> by the <hi>Earth,</hi> by <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the <hi>Altar, Temple,</hi> their <hi>Head,</hi> or the like; nor did they count ſuch forms of ſwearing equally obliging with thoſe oaths wherein the name of God was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and expreſly called upon: to this our Saviour in probability refers in the verſe foregoing my Text, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;</hi> they thought ſuch onely incurr'd the guilt and penalty of perjury who ſtood
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60424:133"/>not to thoſe promiſes they had confirmed by explicit calling the Lord himſelf to witneſs, but that there was but little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or danger either in the common uſe of ſwearing by creatures, or in breaking ſuch oaths.</p>
            <p>Now our Saviour here abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids not onely ſwearing by the ſacred name of God, but alſo by any of his creatures, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> no not ſo much as <hi>by the Heavens, by the Earth,</hi> or <hi>by Jeruſalem;</hi> and the reaſon he gives is becauſe in all ſuch forms of ſwearing by creatures, though God is not expreſly named, yet he himſelf is really referred to, and tacitly invoked, who is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord and maker of all, when you ſwear by the Heavens you call upon him whoſe throne is there placed, when by the earth you appeal to him whoſe foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool it is, when by <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> you impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly and by juſt interpretation ſwear by him that is the great King thereof. This our Saviour as plainly delivers on another occaſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Whoſo ſhall ſwear by the altar, ſweareth by it and all things thereon; and whoſe ſhall ſwear by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſweareth by it and by him that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60424:134"/>therein; and he that ſhall ſwear by Heaven, ſweareth by the throne of God and by him that ſitteth thereon.</hi> So that in this caſe, the truth is, if in ſuch kind of oaths, when men ſwear by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Earth or the like, they mean onely the material ſenſible Heavens and Earth, beſides the irreligion of vain ſwearing, they are guilty of plain idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in giving to the creatures that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is due onely to God; as (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe inanimate beings able to hear them and judge their thoughts, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſincerity of their purpoſes, or to puniſh them for their falſeneſs and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie) but if they do not believe any ſuch thing of thoſe creatures they ſwear by, then muſt ſuch oaths, if they have any ſenſe at all, refer to God, and his name muſt be underſtood to be invoked, even though he be not expreſly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: So that this prohibition of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our may be accounted to extend to all ſuch forms of ſpeech amongſt us, as are uſed as oaths (and ſo underſtood) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get credit to what we ſay, though God be not named; in ſhort, all manner of oaths whether by the Majeſty of God, or any of his creatures, or any words, ſigns
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60424:134"/>or geſtures, which by common cuſtome and interpretation are accounted ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, may be underſtood to be hereby forbidden, as well as direct expreſs ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; for a man may ſwear without ever ſaying a word, if by received uſage ſuch a geſture doth ſignifie our calling God to witneſs; and ſo the forms and outward modes of ſwearing are different in ſeveral Nations, though the reaſon and ſenſe of them be the ſame in all places, whatever words or ſigns are uſed. If therefore ſuch phraſes as theſe, <hi>faith, troth,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others which I might name, are in ordinary eſteem and practice thought to contain ſomething more than an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and are uſed and underſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us as oaths, they are here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Chriſtians under this rule of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not at all, though ſuch words in themſelves have not the force of oaths, nor is God immediately appealed to by them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is farther here to be obſerved, that though all manner of ſwearing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the name of God or any of his creatures be thus prohibited, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> yet this muſt be underſtood onely
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60424:135"/>of arbitrary voluntary ſwearing in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary talk and diſcourſe, when there is no great reaſon, no juſtifiable occaſion for it. It is to be acknowledged that ſome of the ancient Fathers from theſe words did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it utterly unlawfull for a Chriſtian at any time to ſwear; ſome of their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to this purpoſe are quoted by <hi>Grotius</hi> in his comment upon theſe words; but then it is to be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there were but ſome few of them of this opinion, and that againſt the current doctrine of the greateſt part of the primitive Chriſtians; and,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt the known allowed practice amongſt them; for we all along find there were many Chriſtians in the armies of the heathen Emperours, and they could not have ſerved under them without taking the military oath, which they did not uſe to ſcruple, ſo they were not put to ſwear by any of their <hi>Genii,</hi> or <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> or <hi>Fortune,</hi> or the like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their great argument againſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of oaths was drawn from the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible faith and truth of Chriſtians, who
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60424:135"/>upon no conſideration whatever could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be forc'd or won to affirm what they knew to be falſe, or promiſe what they never intended to perform; and this they were ſo remarkable for, that they thought it a diminution or ſcandalous affront of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them to be put to their oaths; they always had ſuch a regard to their words, and it was ſo ſacred a thing at all times to ſpeak truth, that they would not be ſo much diſtruſted or diſparaged as to have the ſecurity of an oath required of them; the conſtant tenour of their lives they thought did bear a greater te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to what the Chriſtians affirmed, and render it more credible than the oaths of any other men could what they witneſſed.</p>
            <p>But now becauſe in latter days ſome <hi>Sectaries</hi> both here and elſewhere have from theſe words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the lawfulneſs of taking of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oaths though thereto required by the Magiſtrate, though it be an oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to their Prince, or when they give teſtimony in a publick cauſe: I ſhall briefly and plainly make out to you that this prohibition of our Saviour's muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60424:136"/>of ſome exceptions, and muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained onely to vain and raſh oaths in our ordinary diſcourſe, which I ſhall doe by deſiring you to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That in other general prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is acknowledged by all that we muſt make the ſame or like excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus though our Saviour hath ſaid a little before theſe words in this Sermon on the Mount, v. 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, and whoſoever ſhall kill ſhall be in danger of the judgment,</hi> yet we all grant that this muſt be confined to private perſons, that this forbids not the Magiſtrate's inflicting capital puniſhments; and then that as to private perſons, it is meant onely of killing innocent men; but that ſtill it is lawfull for us in the preſervation of our own lives to kill thoſe who unjuſtly aſſault us, theſe caſes muſt be reſerved: ſo here, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> that is, not of your own motion, without any neceſſary or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe; but this doth not infringe the right which Magiſtrates have to impoſe oaths on their ſubjects, and to require the utmoſt and greateſt ſecurity for their fidelity and obedience; this doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid ſwearing when it is requiſite for the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60424:136"/>determining of important controverſies or diſtribution of juſtice, when it is for the publick good, that our teſtimony ſhould be credited and made more valid by the ſolemnity of an oath. And that ſuch exceptions as theſe muſt be allowed from this general rule will appear,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider the poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that is oppoſed to this prohibition, <hi>Swear not at all, but let your communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh of evil. Let your communication, i. e.</hi> your ſpeech, your ordinary familiar diſcourſe, <hi>be yea, yea; nay, nay:</hi> which was a proverbial way of expreſſing an honeſt man whom you may believe and truſt. <hi>Juſtorum etiam eſt etiam, &amp; non eorum eſt non: His aye was aye, and his no was no.</hi> His promiſes and performances did exactly and conſtantly agree: without any more adoe you may give credit to, and relie upon whatever he ſays. <hi>Whatever is more than theſe, cometh of evil;</hi> i. e. whatſoever is more than bare affirming or denying any thing, (that is ſtill in our communication, in our ordinary talk and diſcourſe) is from <hi>evil;</hi> from mens
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60424:137"/>ſo commonly breaking of promiſes, and ſpeaking of falſities; from whence that lewd cuſtome of adding oaths proceeds, becauſe they cannot be believed without them. Now therefore ſince our Saviour is here directing us how to govern our common diſcourſe and converſation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the prohibition alſo in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt be reſtrained to the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo the full ſenſe of the words ſeems to me to be this. In your <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, familiari ſermone,</hi> in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk uſe no ſwearing, not ſo much as by any creature; but let it ſuffice barely to affirm or deny, and be always ſo true to your words, that nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need be deſired or expected from you: all other confirmation in ſuch ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affairs is practiſed onely by ſuch as are uſed to lie and diſſemble, and intend to impoſe upon others.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That our Saviour did not here forbid all ſwearing, whatever cauſe there might be for it, as a thing in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, we are fully ſatisfied from the example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his Maſter's mind in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Now it is a very unreaſonable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60424:137"/>thing to imagine, that he ſhould ſo often ſwear, and that by the name of God too, that ſuch his oaths ſhould be recorded in the Scriptures, and that there ſhould not be the leaſt intimation of his ſinning in ſo doing, if all ſwearing was utterly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by his Lord and Maſter. I ſhall propound two or three eminent inſtances to ſhew, that in ſerious and great matters of mighty concernment he made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of adding the confirmation of an oath; Gal. 1.20. <hi>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not.</hi> He bears witneſs to the truth of his writings by an expreſs oath; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>For God is my witneſs whom I ſerve, that without ceaſing I make mention of you always in my prayers.</hi> It was of great moment that in the beginning of his Epiſtle he ſhould perſuade thoſe, to whom he did addreſs himſelf, of his good-will toward them. How well therefore he did wiſh them, he calls God to witneſs, which is the formal eſſence of an oath. Thus again, to name no more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. <hi>The God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is bleſſed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not:</hi> which is a plain appeal to God's te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. So that when the glory of God
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60424:138"/>and the publick good was engaged, he thought it not unlawfull to invoke God's holy name, and to call his Majeſty for a witneſs of his truth, or the avenger of his falſhood. Thus <hi>our bleſſed Saviour</hi> himſelf when he ſtood before the <hi>High-prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did not refuſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer upon oath; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.63. <hi>The High-prieſt ſaid unto him, I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi> which amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was the form of giving an oath; to which our Saviour anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid;</hi> that is, upon my oath it is as thou ſayſt. Nay, to make all ſure, that there is no evil in ſwearing when it is done gravely and ſeriouſly, and upon an important occaſion that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; we find that God himſelf hath been pleaſed to give us his oath. <hi>Though it were impoſſible for him to lye, yet that we might have ſtrong conſolation and full aſſurance, to ſhew the heirs of the promiſe the immutability of his counſel, he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it by an oath; and when he could not ſwear by a greater, he ſwore by himſelf; Heb.</hi> 6.13. And therefore it muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurd to deny amongſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the lawfulneſs of doing that, though upon
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60424:138"/>never ſo great reaſon, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did, nay which <hi>God Almighty,</hi> who is truth it ſelf, did yet vouchſafe out of condeſcenſion to our weakneſs, to doe more than once. Not now to mention <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> both of which have in them the nature of oaths, and are therefore called <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) We are to conſider that ſwearing rightly circumſtanced is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing in it ſelf evil, and ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally forbidden; that it is indeed a moſt eminent part of religious worſhip and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine adoration, by which we do moſt ſignally own and recognize God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to be the great Sovereign Lord and Governour of the world, the higheſt and ſupremeſt Power, to which the laſt and final appeal is in all caſes to be made. By it we acknowledge the immenſity of his preſence, his exact knowledge and continual care of humane affairs, and all things that happen here below; his all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye, that he ſearcheth into the depth of our hearts, and is conſcious to our moſt inward thoughts and ſecret mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. We do by it avow him as the grand Patron of truth and innocence, as
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60424:139"/>the ſevere puniſher and avenger of deceit and perfidiouſneſs. And therefore doth God often in holy Scripture appropriate this to himſelf; <hi>Him onely ſhalt thou ſerve, and to him ſhalt thou cleave, and ſhalt ſwear by his name.</hi> And if this be done with that conſideration and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which doth become ſuch a ſpecial part of devotion; upon an occaſion that doth deſerve, and that will in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure excuſe our engaging the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty as a witneſs in it; I ſay, if it be performed with due awe and reverence, with hearty intention for a conſiderable good, we do, thus calling upon God when we ſwear by him, honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify his great and holy name, as well as by prayer or praiſes, or any other act of religious worſhip whatever.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Add to this the neceſſity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king oaths in order to civil government, publick adminiſtration of juſtice, and the maintaining of good order and peace in Societies. And therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>That an oath for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to men is the end of all ſtrife;</hi> and that not by particular cuſtoms and laws prevailing in ſome places onely, but
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60424:139"/>from the appointment of God, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and fitneſs of the thing it ſelf, and the conſtant practice of all the world in all ages; for as far and wide as the ſenſe of a Deity hath ſpread it ſelf, hath alſo the religion of an oath, and the final determination of matters in difference, by calling to witneſs the Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things; this being the utmoſt aſſurance, and the ſureſt pledge any can give of their faith and ſincerity. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be imagined ſufficient or effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to engage men to ſpeak truth, or to be faithfull and conſtant to their promiſes, if an oath doth not. He muſt ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ſenſe and fear of God, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of duty or regard to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's love and favour, who can with open face call him to teſtify to a lye, or challenge him to puniſh him if he ſpeaks not true, when yet at that very time he knows he does not. This is the greateſt ſecurity men can give of their honeſty, and that they mean as they ſay. And it being neceſſary for the government of the world in ſo many caſes (not proper now to be named) that truth ſhould be found out, and the greateſt certainty of it be given that can poſſibly, and that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60424:140"/>men ſhould by the ſtricteſt ties be obliged to ſome duties; it thence alſo becomes neceſſary that oaths ſhould ſometimes be required, eſpecially when men cannot by other means well aſſure the ſincerity of their intentions, or ſecure the fidelity of their reſolutions.</p>
            <p>I confeſs amongſt Chriſtians in the firſt ages I believe oaths were not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly required in ſuch little matters, as now ſometimes they are, but the reaſon was becauſe truth and honeſty then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed far more amongſt them, and lying was then more ſcandalous than, I fear, perjury is now: but perfidiouſneſs and diſſembling, and equivocating and fraud encreaſing, have made the uſe of oaths more ordinary than otherwiſe would have been neceſſary. For if Chriſtians did generally obſerve the laws of their Religion in all other inſtances, men would fly to this greateſt ſecurity onely in extreme and higheſt caſes, and not find it needfull to require it in common and more trivial matters.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Laſtly, I onely obſerve farther, that what ſeems thus to be the doctrine
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60424:140"/>of our Saviour concerning ſwearing, was delivered by the Philoſophers of old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathens as agreeable to the light of nature and right reaſon: that is to ſay, they adviſed their Scholars to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all oaths as much as poſſibly they could: never to ſwear but when it was neceſſary, to reverence an oath (as <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> expreſs'd it in his golden Verſes) not eaſily or lightly or want only to take God's name into their mouths. I forbear to trouble you with the Authours, or the Sentences themſelves: and I propound this onely to ſhew that the wiſe men of this world did agree with our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this rule which he hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to us concerning ſwearing; and I have been the larger in it that you might ſee what little reaſon any <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us have to ſtand out ſo ſtubbornly againſt the wholſome laws of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the proceedings of the Courts of Judicature; who, though it were to ſave the King's life, will not give their teſtimony upon oath, becauſe our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſum of all is; Our Saviour abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forbids ſwearing in our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60424:141"/>or ordinary diſcourſe together, and about the unlawfulneſs of this there is no diſpute; and ſtrange it is that againſt ſuch expreſs words of our bleſſed Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, men ſhould ſo openly allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a vile practice, and yet have the face to call themſelves his diſciples and followers. This evil of voluntary raſh ſwearing hath prevailed amongſt us even almoſt beyond all hope of cure and remedy. That great Oratour St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> made no leſs than twenty Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or Sermons againſt this fooliſh vice, and yet found it too hard for all his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Rhetorick, till at length he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to force his Auditours to leave off that ſin, if for no better reaſon, yet that he might chuſe another ſubject. They are ordinarily men onely of debauched minds and conſciences that freely indulge themſelves in it; and if any ſuch now hear me, I cannot expect by thoſe few words I have now to deliver, to diſſuade them from it. I had rather endeavour to offer ſomething to <hi>your</hi> conſideration who are not yet infected by it, to perſuade you to watch ſeverely againſt it, and reſolve never to comply with ſuch an impious ſenſeleſs cuſtome.</p>
            <pb n="273" facs="tcp:60424:141"/>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider what an horrid affront it is to the divine Majeſty. All ſin reflects diſhonourably upon God, but other ſins do this by conſequence onely: this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly flies in his face, and immediately impugneth his juſtice and power. Other ſins are acts of diſobedience, but 'tis high contempt of God, thus to toſs about his excellent and glorious name in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed mouths, and to proſtitute it to ſo vile an uſe as onely to fill up the vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our idle prattle. That great and terrible name of God which all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and hoſt of Heaven with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt ſubmiſſion continually adore; which rends the mountains, and opens the bowels of the deepeſt rocks, which makes hell tremble, and is the ſtrength and hope of all the ends of the earth, our onely refuge in the day of trouble, the very thought whereof ſhould fill all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber perſons with a reverential awe and horrour, how do men moſt impudently and raſhly almoſt every minute pollute and tear without fear or ſenſe, or obſerving what they ſay, as if God Almighty, the Maker and Judge of us all, were the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and moſt deſpicable Being in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe?
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60424:142"/>What unaccountable boldneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable ſaucineſs is this, to dare to invoke the dreadfull Majeſty of heaven and earth to witneſs to every impertinent ſaying, ſilly ſtory, vain fancy, almoſt every five words we utter? thus at our pleaſure to ſummon our Omnipotent Creatour, as if he were at our beck, and a ſlave to our humour? thus to play and dally with him who is a conſuming fire, and can in the twinkling of an eye make us all as miſerable as we have been ſinfull? How ſhall we ever be able in the day of our fears to addreſs our ſelves to the throne of his grace, whom every time we ſpeak, we thus madly defy? with what ſhame and regret and confuſion muſt we needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his Judgment ſeat, whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable name we have thus foully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned and uſed ſo ignominiouſly? Can they ever think to plead that bloud of our deareſt Lord, and thoſe wounds made by the ſpear and nails in his moſt pretious body for the pardon and expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their moſt grievous ſins, who thus daily have made a mock of them? Can they ever with the leaſt hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs pray God, when they come to die, to deliver them from that damnation that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60424:142"/>they have a thouſand times before wiſhed to themſelves?</p>
            <p>And yet this ſin which argues ſuch ſlight and abuſe of the divine Majeſty ſuch rudeneſs towards him, and draws ſo many dire conſequences after it, is now adays (pardon me if I ſay it) one of the faſhionable accompliſhments of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that ſhould be precedents of civility or good manners to others; but this is ſo ſad a conſideration that I cannot endure to dwell longer upon it.</p>
            <p>I proceed to other miſchiefs of this vice though none need be named after this; for thoſe whom the awe of God and ſenſe of his power and infinite greatneſs will not keep and reſtrain from ſuch deſperate profanations of his holy name, it is not to be imagined that any leſs arguments ſhould.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This practice of common ſwearing muſt of neceſſity frequently involve men in the heinous ſin of perjury. He that ſwears at every turn in his ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, how often doth he call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs even to what he knows is falſe, and as
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60424:143"/>often forget to doe what before God he hath engaged himſelf to perform? or if he be afraid of this crying ſin of perjury, and be put in mind of what by his need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs oath he had obliged himſelf unto, how many inconveniencies will his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs continually expoſe him unto? You all know how <hi>Herod</hi> was loth for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſake before all his Court to violate his haſty oath, and how that coſt the head of the greateſt Prophet that ever was. By cuſtomary uſing of God's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name men come to vent it when they think not of it, without any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought or conſideration, and by it ſwear to things impoſſible or romantick, to their own fictions and dreams which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe themſelves, nor yet intend to deceive others into a belief of; and oftentimes tranſported by anger or rage they ſwear to things they repent of when they are calm and ſober, and are then quite of another mind; ſo that falſe ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is the certain never-failing effect of much ſwearing; nay indeed it is onely chance or luck in ſuch as every time in the hurry of their diſcourſe call upon God's name that they do not, not onely vainly ſwear, but alſo impiouſly forſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60424:143"/>for whilſt they thus back almoſt every affirmation with an oath, how idle, uncertain or doubtfull ſoever the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be, without making any difference, or at all weighing what they ſay, or being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied concerning the truth of it, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own minds about it, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be freed from the guilt of the ſin of perjury, though what they ſay ſhould happen not to be falſe, or they ſhould be as good as their word, it being by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune onely that it doth prove ſo. And he that ſwears to a thing that chances to be true, (if he knew it not certainly, or did not conſider it whether it were ſo or no, but unadviſedly ſealed it with an oath, though it be as he did ſwear) yet muſt be preſumed guilty of this crime of perjury in the ſight of God, and then I leave it to your ſelves to judge how often by this vile cuſtome of ſwearing men do forſwear themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From hence it follows that this ſin of vain and raſh ſwearing in our ordinary diſcourſe is of very bad influence to the publick ſtate; nothing is ſo pernicious to the government, nay nothing is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of our liberties and properties,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60424:144"/>of which we are ſo fond, and for which we are ſo zealous, as this wicked practice of ſwearing upon all occaſions; as it makes oaths become cheap and vile, ſo it derogates from their ſacredneſs and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for what reaſon can there be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he who makes no conſcience of thoſe many oaths that he daily belches forth upon the ſlighteſt provocations, ſhould be of another opinion, and look on himſelf as more ſtrictly tied up by them when he ſwears allegiance to his Prince, or gives his teſtimony in a Court of Judicature? why ſhould he be more afraid or concerned for calling God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a cauſe wherein his neighbour's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, good name or life is engaged, than he is in his private converſation of invoking the Majeſty of Heaven an hundred times in a day? The fear of the penalty which the laws have appointed for perjury may indeed move him in ſuch caſes wherein there is danger of his being diſcovered, and there is likewiſe a little more ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in ſuch publick ſwearing before a Magiſtrate; but yet what is that to one who hath caſt off all ſenſe and fear of God, and every hour dares openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and deſpiſe him? So that the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60424:144"/>publick laws ought to provide againſt this piece of debauchery as the bane of all ſociety; and we cannot anſwer it in prudence, to have any intercourſe, to hold any correſpondence or tranſactions with, or in any caſe to truſt or rely on his word who feareth not an oath; for,</p>
            <p n="4">4. This practice of ſwearing in our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſcourſe doth highly detract from the credit of the perſon that uſeth it, it renders juſtly ſuſpicious every word he ſays and confirms with an unneceſſary oath; for if the thing be true and certain, and the perſon of unblemiſhed faith, what need can there be of an oath to vouch it; but if he ſwears to it, he declares himſelf not to be worthy of belief, that his word ought in no caſe to be taken, ſince in the moſt indifferent matters he chuſes ſtill to warrant it with an oath, and by thus doing moſt deſervedly forfeits all credit and repute among conſidering perſons.</p>
            <p>A truly honeſt man is ſo well aſſured of his own veracity that he counts it wholly needleſs and uſeleſs to offer an oath as a pledge or pawn of the truth of what he affirms; but if upon every word
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60424:145"/>I am apt to ſwear to it, this is an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſign that either I intend to deceive in that particular, or elſe that I am ſo uſed to lie that I cannot expect to be believed without an oath.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is a vice moſt diſtaſtefull and ungratefull to all the reſt of mankind, moſt ſtrangely offenſive to thoſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with. <hi>The talk of him that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much,</hi> ſaith a wiſe man, <hi>maketh the hair to ſtand upright, and their brawls make one ſtop his ears.</hi> If men harden themſelves againſt other arguments ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the wickedneſs and irreligion of this practice, yet this methinks ought to prevail ſomething with thoſe that pretend to honour and gentile carriage, <hi>viz.</hi> that this is the moſt uncivil and the rudeſt thing that can be offered to other men; it rankly favours of ill manners and want of breeding for them to be continually defying of that Being which all other men adore, and ſpitting out their venom againſt that God whom the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind profeſs to love and honour above all things. Should one of our hectoring ſwearers come into a company, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of which he knew highly valued
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60424:145"/>and prized an abſent friend, never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned him but with all the kindneſs and reſpect imaginable, called him their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, profeſſed mighty obligations to him and believed him one of the beſt of men; would it paſs for a thing tolerably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming or decent for him every word, when no occaſion was offered, to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſpattering and vilifying this perſon, ſo dear to the company, and to ſpeak of him with the greateſt contempt and deſpight? now ſuch is God to the greateſt part of the world, they own all that they have or are to be from him alone, that he is their great benefactour and Saviour, that they are infinitely engaged to him, that they deſire his love and favour above all this world: how is it ſufferable then, in men of faſhion and repute eſpecially, (as is the common practice of too many) when they meet with perſons that are more than others concerned for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, to be ever and anon with their profane talk pelting this holy being, polluting his name with their filthy ſpeech, outbraving his Majeſty, chuſing to doe that which they know grates moſt harſhly upon other men, and which they hate above any thing in the world?</p>
            <pb n="282" facs="tcp:60424:146"/>
            <p n="6">6. That which mightily aggravates this madneſs and folly is, that it is ſuch a ſin as we have no temptation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, nothing to move or ſway us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, it gratifies no natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it produceth no pleaſure, no gain or worldly profit accrues to us by it; it affordeth us not ſo much as any ſhort temporal recompence for the venture we run, and the dangerous hazards we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves unto; other ſorts of ſin have ſomething to excuſe them, our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and bodily tempers may ſtrongly incline, us to ſome other ſins: The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man hath his full bags and great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to plead in his behalf; and as for the voluptuous Epicure, his appetites and luſts are tickled with the variety of ſenſual delights; and the ambitious man hath the contentment he takes in his honours and advancements to anſwer for the loſs of the peace of his mind and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; the drunkard pleads the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his wine and company, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon talks of the reſiſtleſs charms of beauty; but the ſwearer ſelleth his ſoul for nothing; ſo that of all wicked men he is the moſt ſilly and unreaſonable,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60424:146"/>and makes the worſt and maddeſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for himſelf. Nay, other ways of ſinning may be almoſt called wiſedom, if compared to this; For other ſinners ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther project ſomething future, and are delighted with the hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, or enjoy ſomething preſent that pleaſes them and ſatisfies ſome cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inordinate deſire: but this is pure ſinning for ſinnings ſake, onely in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with an ugly imperious cuſtome too much in vogue and faſhion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There is no kind of ſin whatever that doth ſo highly provoke God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to inflict ſome remarkable exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary judgment on a Perſon or Nation, even in this life, as this practice of vain ſwearing by his Name. This almoſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitates him to thunder from Heaven after ſome extraordinary manner, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his power and juſtice and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, all which are ſo notoriouſly abuſed, blaſphemed and challenged by ſuch hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous oaths and dire imprecations. He is e'en forced by ſuch horrid defiances and outrageous darings of him to ſhew his ſtrength and might to the children of men, by ſending ſome grievous plagues
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60424:147"/>and ſore calamities amongſt them, by which they may perceive he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bear ſuch bold prophanations of his truth and honour and majeſty; but will at length return thoſe curſes upon men which they have ſo often wiſhed to themſelves: that he will at laſt puniſh and avenge himſelf of thoſe who have ſo openly and frequently provoked him to it by their dreadfull appeals to him.</p>
            <p>The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews;</hi> that forlorn and forſaken people, the ſcorn of all the earth, are to this day a ſtanding monument of God's implacable anger and wrath upon a like occaſion, when they ſo ſolemnly curſed themſelves, and prayed that the bloud of the holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> might be upon their heads, and the heads of their children. God is jealous and tender of his name, and will not always ſuffer it to be ſcorn'd and reproached. <hi>Becauſe of ſwearing,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>the land mourneth.</hi> God is engaged in honour to right himſelf, and maintain his name from ſuch foul contempt, leſt men ſhould begin to think either that he is not at all, or that he is deaf to all their loud calls and impudent invocations.</p>

Laſtly, I onely add this one pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conſideration to you who now hear me, aſſembled in this place for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of that great God, for the honour of whoſe name I am pleading: that this cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of vain ſwearing is the great ſcandal to our Church of <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe that adhere to it in its preſent eſtabliſhment. This was of old, and is ſtill the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt thoſe of the Church-way, as they ordinarily call us, that ſo many amongſt us allow themſelves in this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practice; nay not onely uſe it, but look on it as their credit ſo to doe. You ſee the fruit, ſay they, of your Common-prayers, of your read devotions, of your decent and orderly worſhip which you ſo much plead for. You may judge of the goodneſs and efficacy of that way, by thoſe oaths and curſes that abound ſo much in thoſe of your profeſſion. And really, what can we anſwer to this charge? can we abſolutely deny it? Muſt we not rather confeſs, amongſt friends at leaſt, that it is in ſome meaſure true, that the Separatiſts and Diſſenters do more generally reſtrain themſelves from this lewd practice, and do not ſo
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60424:148"/>ordinarily allow themſelves in this vice, as too many amongſt us doe? Now it is not a ſufficient anſwer to this to recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and tell them of as great ſins that they are guilty of; that they can lye, cheat and diſſemble, are factious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable, though they will not ſwear, which is ſometimes replied in this caſe: for this, though never ſo true, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to wipe off this diſgrace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion from our Church: but the true anſwer to this is, that thus it always was in the world, and ever will be, that where there are different opinions and parties in Religion, and one is favoured by the publick Laws, and countenanced by the Government, all thoſe who are of no Religion will be ſure to be of that ſide which is uppermoſt, which the King and Court is of, which is freeſt from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So that all the prophane, wicked, diſſolute livers will be of our Church, as long as the doctrine of it is the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed owned Religion of the Nation; but if ever the tide ſhould turn, and another Party get the upper hand, they ſhould have the company of thoſe men alſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome worldly intereſt did interfere and hinder them. Such men of ſuch
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60424:148"/>looſe principles and ſeared conſciences matter not what Religion they profeſs, or whether any at all. But do theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any encouragement or countenance amongſt us? do we boaſt of their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? do we account theſe to live an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to their profeſſion? do not we complain of them as well as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries? and would to God all ſuch as hate to be reformed, would even leave our Church. 'Twould be an happy day if all ſuch ungodly wicked wretches, who will not be won over by the excellent means and arguments of our Religion, would alſo forſake that profeſſion which in practice they diſown, nay, blemiſh and diſcredit; that they would be of any Party, run over to our enemies, rather than continue to diſhonour the beſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and pureſt Church in the world. Ye now who, by your preſence at theſe her ſolemn devotions, ſeem concerned for the glory, preſervation and ſecurity of our Church, it is much in your power to wipe off ſuch blots and aſperſions, to anſwer ſuch reflexions, and to ſtop the mouths of all oppoſers, by a due care and government of all your words and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and by the innocency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameableneſs
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60424:149"/>of your lives, your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned piety and reverence towards God, your invincible truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other remarkable vertues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend our Church even to thoſe who are without: eſpecially be perſuaded to join all your endeavours againſt this vice by keeping a ſtrict guard againſt it, in your ſelves by keeping from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it; by not ſuffering it in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, or thoſe that have any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon you; by mildly and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly warning and reproving thoſe of your neighbours and acquaintance that are guilty of this folly. In a word, let us all obſerve ſuch exact truth in all our chat and diſcourſe, be ſo conſtant to our promiſes, that at any time our word may paſs without any farther engagement, that we may never think it neceſſary to aſſure our credit or faith by an oath.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> was in no caſe permitted to ſwear, becauſe it was not handſome that he who was ſo nearly related to their great God, and charged with ſuch divine matters as the care of Religion, ſhould be diſtruſted about ſmall things. And we know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60424:149"/>our ſelves ſolemn formal oaths are not in many caſes required from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of honour; their word upon their honour hath equal credit with the expreſs oath of inferiour perſons. Now ſuch would our bleſſed Saviour have all his diſciples to be, ſo true and faithfull, that there ſhould be no need of oaths to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their ſpeeches, but that the holineſs and ſtrictneſs of their lives ſhould give ſuch undoubted teſtimony to, and command ſo firm a belief of all they ſay, as that no farther aſſeveration ſhould be able to vouch it more. I conclude all with thoſe ſayings of the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach, Ecclus.</hi> 23.9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A man that uſeth much ſwearing ſhall be filled with iniquity, and the plague ſhall never depart from his houſe. If he ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a word that is clothed about with death, God grant that it be not found in the heritage of Jacob: for all ſuch things ſhall be far from the godly, and they ſhall not wallow in their ſins.</hi>

            <p>THAT the appearance of the ever bleſſed Son of God in our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nature was upon ſome very great and moſt important deſign, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe at all, or at leaſt, not ſo happily
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60424:151"/>by any other means to be accompliſhed, every one muſt needs grant at firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It could not be any indifferent tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial errand or buſineſs that a perſon of ſuch infinite honour and dignity was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about, which brought down God himſelf from the regions or glory and light inacceſſible to dwell in an earthly tabernacle, and to veil the ſplendour of his Majeſty with a body of fleſh. This was ſuch a ſurprizing condeſcenſion of him that had lived from all eternity in the boſome of his Almighty Father, this ſignified ſuch wonderfull love and regard to that humane nature he aſſumed, that all men cannot but reaſonably promiſe themſelves the greateſt advantages ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable from ſuch a gratious undertaking. That our forlorn nature ſhould be thus highly honoured and exalted, as to be after ſuch an unſpeakable manner united to the divine, doth evidently aſſure us of God's good-will towards ſinfull men, that he yet entertained thoughts of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards us, and was loth that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his creatures ſhould prove their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable ruine.</p>
            <pb n="293" facs="tcp:60424:151"/>
            <p>Had God ſent a meſſage to us by the meaneſt ſervant in his heavenly Court, it had been a favour too great for us to have expected, and for which we could never have been enough thankfull. Had he commanded an hoſt of illuſtrious Angels to have flown all over the earth, and loudly to have proclaim'd God's willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have been reconciled to men, ſhould we not all with mighty joy and wonder have regarded and adored ſuch ſtupendous grace and goodneſs, crying out, <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art thus mindfull of him? or the ſon of man, that thou thus viſiteſt him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that God himſelf ſhould deſcend from his heavenly habitation to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with our rags; that he <hi>who thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> ſhould <hi>take on him the form of a ſervant, and be found in the faſhion and likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh,</hi> this aſtoniſhes not onely men, but Angels themſelves: for <hi>he took not on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the nature of Angels,</hi> nor appeared for their reſcue and deliverance, who had left their firſt manſions of glory; but was pleaſed ſo far to humble himſelf, as to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60424:152"/>undertake the cauſe and patronage of us vile worms, ſinfull duſt and aſhes, even whilſt we were enemies, traytours and rebels to his divine Majeſty, and utterly unworthy of the leaſt gratious look from him, though we had never ſo earneſtly beſought it: in our behalf it was that he did mediate and intercede, he ſtepp'd in between guilty wretched us and God's ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; perfected our redemption, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our liberty, and purchaſed eternal life and happineſs for all men on the eaſie and pleaſant conditions of the Goſpel. <hi>And thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus; for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my diſcourſe on theſe words I ſhall onely</p>
            <p n="1">I. Shew you how, or by what means the Son of God became our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or did ſave men from their ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Draw ſome plain inferences from it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. How, or by what means the Son of God became our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or did ſave men from their ſins.</p>
            <pb n="295" facs="tcp:60424:152"/>
            <p>Now in order to the ſalvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the great end of our Saviour's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, theſe two things were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be done; one of which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally reſpects God, the other ſinners themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In order to the ſalvation of ſinners it was neceſſary to obtain and purchaſe the pardon of their ſins, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was farther neceſſary that ſinners themſelves ſhould be reform'd, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their ſins to the love and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of true righteouſneſs and goodneſs; that ſo they might be in ſome meaſure qualified and diſpoſed for God's grace and mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In order to the ſalvation of ſinners it was neceſſary to obtain and purchaſe the pardon of their ſins, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God. It is true indeed, that God Almighty by the unlimited good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compaſſionateneſs of his own nature is infinitely inclin'd to all acts of favour and pity; and he might without
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60424:153"/>wrong to any one (if he had ſeen it fit) abſolutely have pardoned the ſins of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, without any other conſideration than their repentance: but out of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſedom he rather choſe to diſpenſe his pardoning grace after ſuch a manner as ſhould not at all ſeem to reflect upon his exact juſtice, immaculate holineſs, and unchangeable truth, and might not give the leaſt encouragement to ſinners to preſume farther upon his mercy and goodneſs; as it would have done for God lightly and eaſily to have paſſed by ſuch notorious offences, and without any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to have receded from all his threatnings. He would not therefore propound terms of reconciliation with mankind without ſome publick repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divine Honour and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and open manifeſtation of his juſt diſpleaſure againſt ſin and diſobedience.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In order to our reconciliation with God, it was neceſſary that ſome publick reparation ſhould be made of the divine Honour and Authority. The ſins of the world were an unſpeakable affront to the divine Majeſty, and an open ſcorn put upon his moſt excellent Laws and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60424:153"/>Government. Now our mercifull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour inclined to forgive the ſons of men that great debt which they were never able themſelves to diſcharge, yet would ſo contrive it, that his clemency ſhould no ways obſcure or impair the glory of his Sovereign dignity, juſtice and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It was moſt highly congruous, that whilſt he pardoned the offenders, yet his Government ſhould be acknowledged, the righteouſneſs of his Laws vindicated, his Honour and Authority ſecured.</p>
            <p>All which was moſt effectually done by our bleſſed Saviour, the Son of God's negotiating our peace in our nature, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf into the place of ſinners, and anſwering all demands for us. By this the infinite holineſs of God's pure nature was declared to all the world, in that he would have no entercourſe with, nor ever receive into his favour ſuch vile un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy wretches as we were, but onely in and through ſo holy, ſo perfect a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour. By this it appear'd that God at firſt upon good reaſons eſtabliſhed his laws, and pronounced his threatnings, ſince he would not without ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious compenſation go back from them.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60424:154"/>We have now the greateſt cauſe given us to tremble at his ſevere juſtice, to adore his ſovereign power and dominion, even whilſt we admire and feel his love and kindneſs to us; ſince no other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could prevail with God to remit our offences, but the powerfull interpoſition of his onely begotten Son, and his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in our nature thoſe pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were due to our ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) By this appearance of the Son of God was God's hatred and grievous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt ſin moſt abundantly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, in that he would not hear of, nor offer any pardon or mercy without ſuch a valuable ſatisfaction. Here God pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth his utmoſt vengeance againſt ſin, when he delivered up to ſuch a cruel and curſed death that Perſon that was moſt dear to him, and leaſt deſerved any ſuch treatment from him, before he would forgive it. Can we now poſſibly think that there is but little evil in, or that God is not much offended with that which could no other ways be expiated but by ſuch pretious bloud? Can any man imagine that it is a cheap thing to ſin, when God himſelf in our fleſh was
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60424:154"/>bruiſed and buffeted, crowned with thorns, and nailed to the croſs for it? That ſurely was no trifle or indifferent matter that cauſed the Son of God to bleed and die. That ſore was deadly that could be cured by no other balſame but his bloud. If any thing could ſhew the fierceneſs of God's wrath againſt ſin, ſurely it muſt be the gaping wounds and bleeding ſide of our Savour. Look on this his wonderfull humiliation; ſee the pits that were digged in his hands and feet, and the furrows that were made on his back, and then tell me what an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing muſt that be that made God ſo diſpleaſed, and faſtned our bleſſed Lord to the Gibbet. So that by our Saviour's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, obedient life and patient death, the divine honour was more illuſtriouſly repaired, his authority more clearly vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, his juſtice and ſeverity againſt ſin more openly declared, diſobedience more highly diſgraced and condemned, than if all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> had periſhed eternally in their rebellion. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once done by the Son of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in our behalf, this great propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice being offer'd for the ſins of the world, God now thought it fit and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60424:155"/>conſiſtent with the glory of all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and the ends of government, to tender life and peace to ſinners upon the moſt equal and reaſonable conditions of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>This is the admirable temperament and expedient found out by the wiſedom of God, by which God glorifies his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the pardon of ſin without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his juſtice or truth, though he had denounced death againſt it. Thus this bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> opened to us the gates of Paradiſe, removed the flaming Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, took away the partition-wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men, and put us all into a fair capacity of being for ever happy. To him alone do we and all men owe, that God will now deal with mankind upon ſuch favourable conditions, by a new law ſuited and accommodated to our circumſtances and infirmities in this lapſed ſtate; that God upon the account of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s gratious undertaking for us is ready and forward to be reconciled with us, to forgive all that is paſt, and to make us as bleſſed as our natures are capable of: and of this benefit all that hear of the Goſpel do equally partake. For we are
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60424:155"/>not to imagine that our Saviour came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world upon ſo little and narrow a deſign, as onely to reſcue and redeem peremptorily and abſolutely a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular favourites without any conditions, but he hath put all men, thoſe eſpecially to whom his Goſpel is preached, in a ready and eaſie way of obtaining pardon and ſalvation. And thus our redemption, juſtification and ſalvation, as to the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meritorious cauſes, depend onely on our Saviour. In all this work we have not the leaſt hand, we have no place nor part. It was not any thing in us, or that can be done by us, that moved God to contrive, or our Saviour to accompliſh our redemption, but onely the pity he had of us in our forlorn miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Here alſo is the onely comfort and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of guilty minds depreſſed with ſhame and fear for their ſins: that <hi>We have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins.</hi> That we are not to ſtand the brunt of God's anger or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelves, ſince his own Son hath voluntarily offered himſelf to ſcreen man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60424:156"/>from the divine wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. And if we do but thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how great and ſublime a perſon he was, we cannot in the leaſt doubt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency and ſucceſs of his appearing for us. We ought not to deſpair of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing from God, fit for him to grant, when we preſent our ſelves before him with ſuch a Mediatour and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, in whom he is infinitely well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and <hi>who is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come unto God by him.</hi> Thus this <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath ſaved us from our ſins in the firſt ſenſe; that is, obtained and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the pardon of them, and made God placable to us.</p>
            <p>But this is not all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to the ſalvation of ſinners, it is farther neceſſary that men ſhould be freed from the power of ſin, and from their evil natures, and become really good and holy. It is not enough that God ſhould be made willing to forgive our ſins, unleſs we alſo are made willing to forſake them. Chriſt came not to ſave us from the evil conſequences of our ſins whilſt we loved them, and delighted our
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60424:156"/>ſelves in them. He did not purchaſe for us an indulgence or licence to ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment. That indeed had been an employment unworthy of the Son of God, nay an impoſſible task to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled God to unhallow'd and impure minds. The reformation of the world, the reparation of our natures, the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our minds, the implanting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature in men, were as much the deſign of his incarnation, as the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the divine juſtice, to which all the world was obnoxious; and (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me if I ſay it) he is more our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by freeing us from the dominion of ſin, than from the penalty. Our bleſſed Lord had not been ſo kind and gratious to us, had he obtained Heaven for us (could ſuch a thing poſſibly have been) whilſt we continued impenitent, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlike to God.</p>
            <p>Now there are theſe two things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for the recovery of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and making us really happy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for ſins paſt, and ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for the future; and to effect both theſe, no means ſo likely as this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Son of God in our nature.</p>
            <pb n="304" facs="tcp:60424:157"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) As for repentance for ſins paſt, what in the world can be imagined more effectual for the working in men an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous ſhame and ſorrow for what they have done amiſs, than theſe tender offers of God's pardon and acceptance upon our ſubmiſſion and returning to a better mind? We have now all poſſible aſſurance given us that mercy is to be had for the moſt grievous offenders. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can exclude or exempt us from this act of grace, but onely our own wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obſtinate refuſal of life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>All men are in the condition of the prodigal Son in the Parable of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. They have gone aſtray from their Father's houſe after their own inventions; promiſing themſelves indeed great pleaſures and full ſatisfactions in a licentious riotous courſe of life; but ſoon wearied with ſuch painfull drudgeries, and many woefull diſappointments, at laſt they begin to recollect themſelves, to remember that plenty they had enjoy'd of all good things in their Father's houſe, how eaſily and happily they lived whilſt
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60424:157"/>they continued under his mild and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious government, and to think of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thither again; but the ſenſe of their horrid guilt and unworthineſs flying in their faces, fills them with diſmal fears and anxious deſpair, ſo that they cannot hope for any kind reception or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after ſuch an ungratefull rebellion.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſuppoſe this Parable thus continued; that the Father, who was ſo highly provoked, had nevertheleſs ſent his other Son, who had never offended him, into a far Countrey, expoſed to many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and hazards, to ſeek and find out his loſt Brother, to beſeech him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, to promiſe him that he ſhould be dealt with as if he had never diſpleaſed him. Would not ſuch condeſcenſion and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd goodneſs have melted and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the poor Prodigal's heart? what joy would ſoon have o'erſpread his face? with what gladneſs would he have hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd to ſuch an overture? what haſte would he have made home? Could he after this have doubted of his Father's love and kindneſs to him?</p>
            <pb n="306" facs="tcp:60424:158"/>
            <p>This therefore is the greateſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement that can be given to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that God hath now by his Son declared himſelf exorable and placable, more willing to forgive, than we can be to ask it of him; and can we deſire par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and peace upon more equal and eaſie terms? Can any thing be conceived more reaſonable, than that before our ſins be forgiven, we ſhould humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our faults, and with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart reſolve to doe ſo no more? and if ſuch love and kindneſs of Heaven towards us will not beget ſome relenting and remorſe in us, if ſuch powerfull ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will not prevail with us to grow wiſe and conſiderate, it is impoſſible that any ſhould.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As for ſincere obedience for the future, without which we can never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God, nor be made happy; this alſo our Saviour hath moſt ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged us to; by his doctrine clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing God's mind and will to us, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before us his own moſt excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, promiſing us all needfull help and aſſiſtence, and propounding eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60424:158"/>and puniſhments as the motives of our obedience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath clearly revealed to us God's nature, and his whole mind and will concerning our ſalvation. He came into the world a Preacher of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, plainly to inſtruct mankind in all their duty towards God, themſelves, and one another. He freed men from the intolerable yoke of many burthenſome and coſtly ceremonies, and brought in a rational ſervice, an everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſiſting in purity, humility and charity; all his commands being ſuch as are moſt becoming God to require, and moſt reaſonable for us to perform. They are moſt agreeable to our beſt underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, perfective of our natures, fitted to our neceſſities and capacities, the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that can be made for the peace of our minds, quiet of our lives, and mutual happineſs even in this world: they are eaſie and benign, humane and mercifull inſtitutions, and all his laws ſuch as we ſhould chuſe to govern our ſelves by, were we but true to our ſelves, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our own intereſt. He hath not denied us the uſe or enjoyment of any
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60424:159"/>thing but what is really evil and hurtfull to us; he hath conſidered our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and manifold temptations, maketh allowances for our wandrings and daily failings, and accepteth of ſincerity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of abſolute perfection; ſo that the advantages and excellency of his laws are as great an argument to oblige us to the obſervance of them, as the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by which they were enacted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Saviour propounded himſelf an example of all that he required of us, the better to direct us in our duty, and to encourage us to the performance of it; ſince nothing is expected from us, but what the Son of God himſelf was pleaſed to ſubmit unto. He converſed therefore publickly in the world, in moſt inſtances that occur in humane life; giving us a pattern of an innocent and uſefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, thereby to recommend his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to us, and to oblige us to tread in his ſteps, and to follow him as the leader and great Captain of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He hath promiſed, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually afford the mighty aſſiſtences of his holy Spirit to all thoſe who humbly
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60424:159"/>beg it of him, to ſtrengthen them in every good work, and to join with, and ſecond their faithfull endeavours. He will never fail an honeſt mind, nay he doth firſt ſtrive with men, prevent and ſurprize them by his good motions and ſuggeſtions. He doth not ſlight any weak attempts, but cheriſheth the very firſt beginnings of vertue and goodneſs. He doth not forſake us at our firſt refuſal, but ſtill ſtands at the door knocking, waiting our amendment. He is always ready at hand to help and ſuccour us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all temptations or diſcouragements that we may meet with in our Chriſtian courſe. He hath appointed many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means of grace, and even to this day hath continued his Miniſters and <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors</hi> in the world to <hi>beſeech men in his name to be reconciled to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. He hath engaged us to the doing of God's will by moſt glorious rewards, even everlaſting pleaſures and immortal happineſs, <hi>ſuch as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor could it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> and ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that no means might be omitted likely to work upon reaſonable creatures,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60424:160"/>he hath denounced moſt ſevere threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt all thoſe who refuſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his gratious offers, even eternal flames, remedileſs torments and miſeries, and that they ſhall be doomed for ever to the company, and partake of the fate of Devils and infernal Fiends. Thus our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord hath propounded the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of fear to keep men from ſin, and alſo preſented the moſt deſireable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of hope to encourage men to be good.</p>
            <p>And to give us the greateſt aſſurance of all this that we can poſſibly deſire, he hath confirmed and eſtabliſhed his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, not onely by thoſe undoubted mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he wrought, and ſufferings he underwent in atteſtation to its truth and divinity, but alſo by his own reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, and viſible aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven; where in our nature he hath taken poſſeſſion of that eternal joy which he purchaſed for us, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for ever at God's right hand to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for us, to protect and rule his Church, to diſtribute his gifts and graces, to ſubdue all our enemies, and at laſt to inſtate all his true diſciples in the ſame glory and eternal life he is now poſſeſſed
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60424:160"/>of; and ſo to become their complete Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>All this is a very imperfect deſcription of but a little part of what our Saviour hath really done towards the reformation and amendment of ſinners: for indeed there is nothing that could have been done towards the ſalvation of men which this <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath not done for us: And I believe all the world may be challenged to name any one help, motive or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the love and ſervice of God, that is ſuited to the nature of God, of Man, and of Religion, which is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to us by this appearance of the Son of God in our nature to mediate for us. By the Goſpel it is therefore that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaves ſinners, which is therefore called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew firſt, and then to the Greek;</hi> it being moſt admirably contrived to the end it was deſigned for, the <hi>opening of</hi> mens <hi>eyes, and turning them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="312" facs="tcp:60424:161"/>
            <p>And this the holy Scriptures often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to us, that <hi>for this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil; might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from our vain converſation,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our minds, and form them over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and <hi>purify to himſelf a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple zealous of good works.</hi> And all that our Saviour did and ſuffered for us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the procuring of our pardon and peace will ſignify nothing to us, will not be in the leaſt available for our benefit, unleſs he firſt ſave us from our ſins, by waſhing and cleanſing our natures, and ſubduing all our luſts and inordinate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and making us conformable to his own image in true holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. 'Twill be no advantage to us that he was born into this world, unleſs he be formed in our minds, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new creatures, ſuch as he requires us to be. Now in all this our Saviour deals with men according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as rational governable creatures, moves them by hopes and fears, draws them with the cords of a man, and will have heaven and happineſs be the reward of their own vertuous choice and free obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <pb n="313" facs="tcp:60424:161"/>
            <p>The ſhort of all is this. In the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (which as at this time he came down from Heaven to reveal to men) God Almighty, out of his infinite compaſſion to his degenerate creatures, hath preſcribed ſuch methods, appointed ſuch means, given ſuch examples, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, aſſiſtences, that nothing can be thought fit and likely to promote the ſalvation of all men, but what his goodneſs and wiſedom have therein moſt abundantly ſupply'd us with, unleſs we would have him offer violence to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of our will, and force us to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and happy whether we will or no, which would be to alter our natures, and make us another ſort of creatures; but ſuch care is taken, ſuch proviſion is made for our happineſs, that we have nothing left us but onely the power of being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, if it be our reſolved mind (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all poſſible obligations to the contrary) to be ſo.</p>
            <p>If men will ſtop their ears againſt the voice of the Charmer, though he charm never ſo wiſely, if they will chuſe, court and embrace ſin and ruine; if the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60424:162"/>arguments will not prevail, if the moſt forcible engagements will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade; if neither the moſt glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, nor the ſevereſt threatnings, nor intereſt, nor ſelf-love, nor any of thoſe conſiderations by which men are ſwayed in other affairs, will at all move them in matters of greateſt moment, they muſt periſh, and that moſt deſervedly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably. If after all this ſinners will die, and be damned even as it were in ſpite of Heaven, maugre all that God or Chriſt hath done for them, they muſt e'en thank themſelves for it, and are onely to charge it upon their own wilfull and incurable folly and baſe contempt of ſuch infinite love and kindneſs. Thus I have briefly ſhewn you how, or by what means, the Son of God truly became our <hi>Jeſus</hi> or Saviour by <hi>ſaving his people from their ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. It onely remaineth that in a few words I draw ſome concluſions from what I have ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Son of God, as Saviour of the world, is beſt ſecured and exalted by an
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:60424:162"/>actual obedience to his laws; that we ought not to ſhift off all duty and work from our ſelves upon him alone, leaving it wholly to him to ſave us if he pleaſeth, without any care or trouble of ours, nor truſt to, and relie altogether upon his righteouſneſs and obedience, without any of our own; ſince, as I have ſhewn you, he muſt ſave us from the power of our ſins, before ever he will ſave us from the penal conſequences of them. So that the efficacy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s undertaking for us, and the neceſſity of our own perſonal righteouſneſs do very well conſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and each hath its proper work in obtaining the pardon of our ſins, and the favour of God. Our Saviour's incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perfect obedience even unto death, is the ſole meritorious cauſe of our acceptance with God, and of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. He alone purchaſed thoſe great benefits for us, made atonement, paid our ranſome, and procured this covenant of grace from God, wherein eternal life is promiſed to penitent ſinners. But then theſe great advantages are not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and abſolutely conferr'd upon us, but under certain qualifications and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of repentance, faith, and ſincere
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60424:163"/>obedience; for the performance of which the holy Spirit is never wanting to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeavours. We do therefore vilely affront and diſgrace our bleſſed Lord, when we boldly expect to be ſaved by him whilſt we continue in our ſins. Nay we ought to think our ſelves as much beholden to him for his doctrine, and the aſſiſtences of his grace, and the glorious promiſes of the Goſpel, by which we are made truly holy and righteous, as for his ſufferings and death, by which he ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God's juſtice, and purchaſed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall hence make that inference of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How then ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Hath God ſo abundantly provided for our happineſs, hath his onely begotten Son done and ſuffer'd ſo much for it, and ſhall we be ſo ſottiſh and ſtupid as fooliſhly to deſpiſe it, when it hath been ſo ſignally the unwearied care of Heaven to procure it for us? It is onely our own advantage that is deſign'd, God projects no private profit, nor doth any accrue to him from the ſalvation of all mankind. Shall we our ſelves therefore madly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:60424:163"/>all theſe deſigns of grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us by our invincible reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to ruine and undoe our ſelves? Did the onely begotten Son of God as at this time deſcend from the regions of bliſs and happineſs, was he born into this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable world, and did he humble himſelf to take our fleſh, that by that means he might exalt mankind, and make us capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of dwelling in the higheſt Heavens, and all this out of mere pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our deſperate condition; and ſhall we think the denying our ſelves a luſt, or the ſatisfaction of a forbidden appetite, or a ſhort-liv'd pleaſure too much for the obtaining the ſame glory? Did he live here a poor, mean and contemptible life, and at laſt die a ſhamefull death to merit eternal life for us; and for the obtaining the ſame, ſhall we grudge to live a ſober, temperate and honeſt life?</p>
            <p>Oh how will this conſideration one day aggravate our torment! What vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anxiety will it one day create in our minds, with what horrour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair will it fill our guilty ſouls? Had God predeſtinated us from all eternity to everlaſting miſery, ſo that it had been
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60424:164"/>impoſſible for us to have avoided our ſad fate; had he never provided a Mediatour and Redeemer for us, it would have been a great eaſe in another world to conſider that we could no ways have eſcaped this doom. But when we ſhall reflect upon the infinite love and kindneſs of God, and how deſirous he was that all men ſhould be ſaved; when we ſhall conſider the wonderfull pity and compaſſion of our Saviour in being born and dying for us, and procuring for us ſuch eaſie terms of ſalvation, and ſo often by his Spirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and exciting us to our duty, and the care of our ſouls; when we ſhall think of thoſe many obligations he hath laid upon us, and the wiſe methods he hath uſed for our recovery and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and how that nothing was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on God's part, but that we might now have been praiſing, bleſſing and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his goodneſs and wiſedom amongſt the glorified Spirits in the happy regions of undiſturbed peace and joy; and yet that we through our own moſt ſhamefull neglect (though often warned to the contrary) are now forced in vain to ſeek but for a drop of water to cool the tip of our tongues. How will this heighten
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60424:164"/>our future pains, and prove the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Hell?</p>
            <p>Better ſhall it be in the laſt day for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> places overrun with luſt and barbarity; for the Nations that ſit in darkneſs, and never heard of theſe glad tidings of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, than for you to whom this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is come; but you caſt it behind your backs. The fierceſt vengeance, the ſevereſt puniſhments are reſerved for wicked Chriſtians, and what can we imagine ſhall be the juſt portion of thoſe whom neither the condeſcenſion and kindneſs, nor wounds and ſufferings of the Son of God could perſuade; nor yet the excellency, eaſineſs and profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his commands invite, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of unexpreſſible rewards allure, nor the threatnings of eternal puniſhment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to live and be happy?</p>
            <p>In vain therefore do ſuch come hither to celebrate the memory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s birth. They of all men who deſpiſe this great ſalvation, purchaſed by the Son of God, have no great cauſe to rejoyce this day; nay, happy had it been for them (who
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60424:165"/>ſtill perſiſt in their ſins, notwithſtanding all that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done to ſave them from them) if this holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> had never been born.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Let us all improve this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity to return our moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble praiſes and thankſgivings for ſo great and unvaluable a bleſſing, and to join our voices, as well as we are able, with thoſe bright <hi>Seraphims</hi> and that <hi>heavenly Hoſt</hi> that attended and celebrated <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s nativity; (when the Heavens proclaimed his birth with their loud ſhouts of joy) ſaying, <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt, on earth peace, good-will towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, for ever bleſſed be his holy name, who hath found out a way for our deliverance, <hi>and hath raiſed up for us a mighty ſalvation; that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the days of our life. Praiſe therefore the Lord, O our ſouls, and all that is within us praiſe his holy name; and forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth all our iniquities, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all our diſeaſes; who hath redeemed
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60424:165"/>our life from deſtruction, and hath crowned us with loving-kindneſs and tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhall we now return, what do we not owe to him who came down from his imperial Throne, and infinitely deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf, and eclipſing the brightneſs of his glorious Majeſty, became a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, nay a curſe, for our ſakes, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our eſtate, and to raiſe us to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of his divine nature, and his eternal glory and bliſs?</p>
            <p>To him therefore let us now all offer up our ſelves, our ſouls and bodies and ſpirits, and that not onely to be ſaved by him, but to be ruled and governed by him; and this he will take as a better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our gratitude, than if we ſpent never ſo many days in verbal praiſes and acknowledgments of his love and bounty.</p>
            <p>Let us all open our hearts and breaſts to receive and entertain this great friend of mankind, this glorious lover of our ſouls, and ſuffer him to take full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them, and there to place his throne, and to reign within us without
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:60424:166"/>any rival or competitour; and let us humbly beg of him, that he would be pleaſed to finiſh that work in us which he came into the world about; that by his bloud he would cleanſe and waſh us from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit; that he would ſave us from our ſins here, and then we need not fear his ſaving us from everlaſting deſtruction hereafter.</p>
            <p>Which God of his infinite mercy grant to us all for the alone ſake of our bleſſed Lord and Redeemer, to whom with the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>THOUGH repentance be a duty never out of ſeaſon, nay is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the work and buſineſs of our whole lives, all of us being obliged every day to amend, yet there are ſome particular times, wherein we are
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:60424:167"/>more eſpecially called upon, to review our actions, to humble our ſouls in God's preſence, to bewail our manifold tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and to devote our ſelves afreſh to his ſervice; ſuch are times of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either perſonal or publick, when extraordinary judgments are abroad in the earth, or are impendent over us; or when we our ſelves are viſited with any ſickneſs or grievous calamity: ſo alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, we are then more ſtrictly to examine our ſelves, and renew our vows and reſolutions of living better. And to name no more, the <hi>Church</hi> in all ages hath thought fit to ſet a-part ſome ſolemn times to call upon men more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to repent, and to ſeek God's face before it be too late; ſuch were the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting-days before the feaſt of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and accordingly our <hi>Church,</hi> as you have heard in the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation this day read to you, doth at this time eſpecially move us to earneſt and true repentance; that we ſhould <hi>return unto our Lord God with all contrition and meekneſs of heart, bewailing and lamenting our ſinfull lives, acknowledging and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our offences, and ſeeking to bring forth
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:60424:167"/>worthy fruits of penance.</hi> And ſuch as now ſeriouſly ſet themſelves to repent of all the ſins they have committed, uſing ſuch abſtinence as is neceſſary for the ſubduing the fleſh to the ſpirit, do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly keep <hi>Lent</hi> far better than they who for ſo long time onely ſcrupulouſly abſtain from all fleſh, and call filling themſelves with the choiceſt fiſh, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats and wine, faſting.</p>
            <p>I ſhall at this time ſuppoſe you ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtructed in the nature of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (it being one of the <hi>firſt principles of the doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.) and alſo that you will readily acknowledge the indiſpenſible neceſſity of it, in order to the obtaining the pardon of your ſins, and eternal life: and that which I now deſign, is onely to ſet before you ſome, if not the main hindrances and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that keep men from repentance, and to endeavour to remove them; and I ſhall diſcourſe in order of theſe three of the many that might be mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Want of conſideration.</p>
            <pb n="326" facs="tcp:60424:168"/>
            <p n="2">II. The unſuccesfulneſs of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer attempts; when men have reſolved and begun to reform, but have ſoon found all their good purpoſes and endeavours blaſted and defeated, this diſcourageth them from making any farther trials.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The hopes of long life, and ſome better opportunity of repenting hereafter.</p>
            <p>One of theſe is commonly the ground and cauſe of thoſe mens remaining in an impenitent ſtate, who yet are convinced of the abſolute neceſſity of repentance in order to their peace and happineſs.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Want of conſideration. For could men but once be perſuaded ſeriouſly and in good earneſt, as becometh reaſonable creatures, to conſider their ways and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, patiently to attend to the dictates of their own minds, and ſoberly to weigh the reaſons and conſequences of things, their is no doubt to be made, but Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would every day gain more proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, vertue and righteouſneſs would proſper and flouriſh more in the world, and men would ſoon become aſhamed
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60424:168"/>and afraid of nothing ſo much as vice and wickedneſs. Of ſuch infinite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the matters of Religion, ſo mighty and ſtrong are the arguments which it propounds to us, ſo clear and convincing are the evidences it gives us of its truth and certainty; ſo agreeable to our minds are all its principles, ſo amiable and excellent its precepts, ſo pleaſant and advantageous is the practice of them, that there ſeemeth nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required to make all men in love with it, but onely that they would open their eyes to behold its beauty, that they would not ſtop their ears againſt all its moſt alluring charms.</p>
            <p>Let men but once throughly ponder the folly and miſchief of ſin, with the benefits and rewards of piety and an holy life; let them but compare their ſeveral intereſts together, and look ſometimes beyond things preſent unto that ſtate wherein they are to live for ever, and uſe their underſtandings about theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as they do about other affairs, and it is impoſſible they ſhould enjoy any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable peace or eaſe without a carefull and ſtrict proviſion for another world.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60424:169"/>Vice oweth its quiet poſſeſſion of mens minds onely to their ſtupidity and inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, to their careleſneſs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: it reigns undiſturbedly onely in ignorant, ſecure, unthinking ſpirits, but ſtreight loſeth all its force and power when once men begin to look about them, and bethink themſelves what they are doing, and whither they are going. Could we but once gain thus much of wicked men, to make a ſtand, and pauſe a little, and to ceaſe but a while from the violent purſuit of their pleaſures, and fairly reflect upon their lives, and ſee what is the fruit of all their paſt follies, and conſider the end and iſſue of theſe things; could we, I ſay, but obtain thus much, we might ſpare moſt of our pains ſpent in perſuading them to repent, their own thoughts would never ſuffer them to be in quiet till they had done it. Let us but once begin to deliberate and examine, and we are ſure on which ſide the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage will lie: ſin and wickedneſs can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtand a trial, let our own reaſons be but judges; it hates nothing ſo much as to be brought to the light. A vitious man, however he may brave it in the world, yet can never juſtify or approve himſelf
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:60424:169"/>to his own free thoughts; and however he may plead for ſin before others, yet he can never anſwer the objections his own conſcience would bring againſt it, would he but once dare impartially to conſider them.</p>
            <p>But the miſery of wicked men is, that they induſtriouſly baniſh all ſuch trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome gueſts out of their minds, inſtead of debating with themſelves, the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and fitneſs of any of their actions, they will not endure ſo much as to hold any parly or diſcourſe with themſelves; they endeavour either by a conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſenſual delights to charm and lull aſleep, or elſe by a counter-noiſe of revellings and riotous exceſſes to drown the ſofter whiſpers of their conſciences; or elſe the hurry and tumult of this world, multiplicity of buſineſs and ſecular affairs, temporal projects and deſigns, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily concerns, do ſo wholly engroſs and prepoſſeſs their thoughts, that they are not at leiſure for any ſuch ſerious reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. They chuſe to divert themſelves by any folly or vanity, by which they may ſtiflle and choak all ſuch good motions; they hate nothing ſo much as
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:60424:170"/>being alone, or at a diſtance from their dear companions in ſin, for fear leſt ſome affrighting apprehenſions ſhould ſteal or force their way in; till at laſt they come to inherit the portion of fools; that is, for ever lament and curſe their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitance and indiſcretion.</p>
            <p>Now till wicked men enter into ſuch deep and earneſt conſideration of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own eſtates, it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the means of grace, the calls of the Goſpel, or the motions of God's Spirit, ſhould have any force or efficacy upon them, as that a man's body ſhould be nouriſhed by meat that he doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, or that a medicine put into a man's pocket ſhould preſerve his health. The moſt invincible arguments cannot gain aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent till they firſt obtain attention; and it is all one to be wholly ignorant of, or not to conſider the danger we are in; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ordinary way by which God brings ſuch men to repentance, is firſt by ſome ſudden affliction or affrighting providence to awaken and rouſe them up to a ſerious conſideration of their evil ways, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate condition, which by degrees may improve into an hearty contrition, and thorough reformation.</p>
            <pb n="331" facs="tcp:60424:170"/>
            <p>And oh that I could now prevail with any one that hath hitherto lived in eaſe, in a courſe of diſobedience to God's laws, to go home and diligently conſider with himſelf, and count up what he hath got by all his moſt beloved ſins, what a dreadfull and manifeſt danger he runs, how ſad and diſmal his reckoning one day muſt needs be; how inexcuſable he is in his folly, how ſhort the pleaſures of ſin are, and how ſore the puniſhments, and that it is yet, through God's grace, poſſible for him to eſcape them; and theſe and ſuch like thoughts for a while cheriſhed, would ſurely beget relentings, or at leaſt reſolutions of repentance and amendment: and if we would doe thus frequently, if we would daily ſet our ſelves to this work, we ſhould be more and more confirmed in ſuch good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
            <p>It is much to be hoped, that none of us here preſent, who ſhew ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Religion, as to join in the ſolemn worſhip of God, are ſo far hardned in ſin, but that we have ſome lucid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, ſome ſober moods, wherein we give our conſciences leave to ſpeak to,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60424:171"/>and admoniſh us; an uneaſie bed, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſleep, will ever and anon bring theſe things to your remembrance; oh do not ſtreight fly from them, nor thruſt them out of your minds; nay be not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely to give them a fair hearing, but never leave thinking of them, and revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them over in your minds, till they have transformed you into new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>For if you will not conſider theſe things now, let me tell you, the time will ſurely ſhortly come, when you ſhall conſider them whether you will or no; when your ſins ſhall ſet themſelves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before you, and it ſhall not be in your power to forget them, or to divert your thoughts from thoſe things which you are now ſo loth to think upon. Here indeed in this life the thoughts of God and a future ſtate often preſent and offer themſelves to us, they often ſpring up in our minds, and when expelled, recur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but men find out ſeveral ways and artifices whereby to hinder their fixing or abiding upon their ſpirits, or at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing their lives; but the time will come, when we ſhall be forced to bring
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60424:171"/>our evil ways to remembrance, and yet then conſideration will doe us no good, nor ſerve to any other purpoſe, but onely to aggravate our miſery, and double our torment. This is the firſt moſt general hindrance of repentance, want of conſideration.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another hindrance of repentance is the unſuccesfulneſs of ſome former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; for when men have reſolved, and perhaps begun to reform, but have ſoon found all their good purpoſes and endeavours blaſted and defeated, they are apt to be thereby diſcouraged from making any farther trials. They have long had it in the purpoſe of their hearts to leave their ſins, nay ſometimes they have prevailed againſt them for ſome time, and withſtood ſome fair tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but yet at laſt nature did, they know not how, return, and they have been perſuaded to renew their old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with thoſe ſins which they had once forſaken: and in their conflicts with ſin they have been ſo often foiled, that they now deſpair of ever getting the day; ſhould they once again reſolve to enter upon a new courſe of life, they fear
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60424:172"/>they ſhould onely add to the number of their offences, the breach of this vow, as they have already of many others which they formerly made.</p>
            <p>This is the condition of many men in the world, and a very dangerous one it is; they have not yet ſinn'd themſelves paſt all ſenſe or feeling, but have ſome regrets and frequent remorſes, and when their ſpirits are at any time diſturbed with the ſenſe of their guilt, they then bethink themſelves ſeriouſly of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a better mind, reſolve upon a new life, and that preſently too, and perform ſome duties in order to it, and are for a little time more carefull and watchfull over themſelves, and their ways; but they are ſoon diſheartened, <hi>their goodneſs is but like a morning cloud, and as the early dew it paſſeth away,</hi> they are ſoon again eaſily frighted or tempted from their duty; upon any little diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement that they meet with, they repent themſelves of their good choice, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their vertuous reſolutions, and, which is worſt of all, this they often doe; they often reſolve to begin, and as often ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to perform what they promiſed;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60424:172"/>and thus they continue running an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs weariſome circle, of ſinning, and then reſolving againſt it, and then upon the next inviting opportunity ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; till at laſt, when they have found ſo many trials and eſſays prove fruitleſs and unſuccesfull, and their good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſo often overpower'd, they e'en fit down contented ſlaves to their vices and luſts.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, what I have now repreſented to you, ought not in the leaſt to diſcourage your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of amendment, but ſhould rather engage you to greater deliberation, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and caution in your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in it. That your good purpoſes have ſo often proved ineffectual, is not a reaſon for not reſolving again, but onely for not doing it raſhly, inconſiderately, and by halves. The fault is certainly your own, that you have ſo frequently failed and come ſhort; it was not from any defect on God's part, in not affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you ſufficient grace, but you were ſome way plainly wanting and unfaithfull to your ſelves. And the miſcarriage of former trials onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60424:173"/>you to begin again with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care, courage and ſincerity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore briefly mention to you the chief conditions or qualifications of ſuch a reſolution as is like to hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all temptations and oppoſition, by which we may alſo ſee how it comes to paſs that mens good purpoſes do ſo often prove abortive.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we would reſolve effectually, we muſt take care to found our good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes upon ſuch reaſons and arguments as are univerſal, and oblige us to a thorough change, and hold indifferently for all places, circumſtances and conditions. Our pious reſolutions muſt not be made upon any contingent particular reaſons, which may ſoon chance to ceaſe, and when they do, we ſhall be in manifeſt danger of returning back to our old courſes. For inſtance, Suppoſe any one to be ſurpriſed in any baſe and unworthy action, and to have endured the ſhame and puniſhment of it, and upon theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to reſolve with himſelf, that he will never be guilty of the ſame again; but afterwards it happens that this man
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60424:173"/>meets with ſuch a temptation to that ſin, as that he may be confident of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with privacy and ſafety; judge you, whether, if he be not furniſhed with other arguments, he will not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fall into the ſnare, and break all his former vows to the contrary: and this is the caſe of all thoſe who reſolve for the practice of Religion, for ſome particular convenience, or to avoid ſome preſent evil, ſuch as loſs of credit, trade or gain, to preſerve their health, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige their relations, to pleaſe their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, or the like for theſe at the beſt are but ſlight and mean arguments for Religion, and they commonly hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome ſins onely; and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may eaſily be ſo changed, that they may become no reaſons or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all.</p>
            <p>Thus one man reſolves to live well, becauſe he finds he ſhall not live long; but a good air, temperate diet, and wholſome phyſick alter the ſtate of his body and mind both together: and ſo the intemperate perſon, when he hath filled and ſtretch'd his veſſels with wine to their utmoſt capacity, and is grown
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60424:174"/>weary and ſick, and feels thoſe qualmes and diſturbances that uſually attend ſuch exceſſes, reſolves then, that he will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after contain himſelf within the bounds of ſobriety; till within a little while he recovers his former debauch, and is well again, and then his appetite returns, and his company invites, and he forgets both the trouble that his ſin created, and the promiſes that he made againſt it.</p>
            <p>But now he that would reſolve for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment ſucceſsfully, muſt doe it upon ſuch grounds as theſe; namely, the evil and baſeneſs of ſin it ſelf, and the excellency of vertue and goodneſs, out of the ſenſe of his ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Maker, and the worth and value of his own immortal ſoul; out of gratitude to God and our bleſſed Saviour, who hath done and ſuffered ſo much for us, out of a full belief of God's continual preſence with us, and inſpection over us, and the ſtrict account he will one day call us to; out of fear of the vexations of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed conſcience, and thoſe eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that await all impenitent ſinners, and out of hopes of that glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſhall be the reward of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing:
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60424:174"/>for theſe reaſons will at all times ſerve to ſtabliſh and confirm our vertuous reſolutions, they will always hold good, as long as men are in their wits, they are ſufficient to anſwer every temptation, and oblige equally againſt all ſin, in all places, and upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let our reſolutions be made upon the matureſt, and moſt deliberate conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all things that can occur to our thoughts: An haſty ſudden vow is ſoon forgot, and this is one great reaſon why mens good purpoſes ſo often fail; namely, that when they are ſerious and devout, or ſcared, they then in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and in groſs reſolve for the future to live well and religiouſly, when yet, alas! they know not what is meant by it; and ſo when they come to be tried in any particular part of Religion, this they never thought of before, nor did they ever intend to oblige themſelves to it.</p>
            <p>Before therefore thou engageſt thy ſelf, conſider well all circumſtances, and the ſeveral inſtances of Religion; what thou muſt part with, what companies
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60424:175"/>thou muſt forſake, what friendſhip and acquaintance thou muſt renounce, what pleaſures and profits thou muſt deny thy ſelf, what ſtrict duty and ſervice will be required of thee; and then moſt ſeriouſly examine thy ſelf, can I march through all theſe inconveniences, and overcome all the difficulties and temptations that may or can befall me in this new enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe? conſult thy judgment, affections and inclinations, and make thy determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon every particular, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as jealous and ſuſpicious of thy ſelf as poſſibly thou canſt, always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that vaſt difference that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things as they are onely repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by our fancies, and when they become actually and ſenſibly preſent to us: This I muſt doe, that I muſt avoid; I muſt never gratify this luſt, no not once more, whatever opportunity, provocation or deſire I may have to it; I muſt hold to this practice not onely this day, not onely at ſome certain times and ſeaſons, but conſtantly throughout the whole courſe of my life, ſhall I not ſoon grow weary of ſuch ſtrictneſs? All my world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs, all my fleſhly pleaſures muſt give place to this reſolution; and can
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:60424:175"/>my heart fully, without any reſerve, conſent to ſuch an univerſal alteration? How many will this change offend? how many flouts and jeers muſt I expoſe my ſelf to by this repentance? how ſhall I anſwer ſuch an old acquaintance when he invites me to an intemperate cup? can I now wholly abſtain from what I have ſo long allowed my ſelf in?</p>
            <p>Thus conſider all things well and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly in thy mind before thou doſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, that it may be the deliberate act of the whole man, that thy underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may perfectly approve of it, being fully convinced of its reaſonableneſs; that thy will may wholly conſent to it, that all thy affections may yield up themſelves and ſubmit to it, ſo that nothing that can befall thee afterwards may be able to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thee becauſe it was not foreſeen, or make thee doubt of the wiſedom of thy choice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Renew theſe thy good purpoſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, every day, yea many times every day, at leaſt whilſt they are freſh, and thou art juſt beginning thy repentance; frequently propound the ſame things to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:60424:176"/>thy thoughts and judgment, that thou mayſt ſee it is not any particular heat or fancy that forms thy reſolution.</p>
            <p>For this is another ordinary cauſe why ſome mens good reſolutions do not hold but, namely, becauſe they are the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental effect of ſome paſſionate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within them, of ſome fright or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, rather than their deliberate judgment; they depend upon ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent heat, good mood or pang of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which laſts not long upon them, and ſo conſequently their reſolutions have but little force and efficacy. There are ſome men of that facile temper, that they are wrought upon by every object they converſe with, whom any affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate diſcourſe, or ſerious Sermon, or any notable accident, ſhall put into a fit of religion, which yet uſually laſts no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than till ſomewhat elſe comes in their way, and blots out thoſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and theſe men are good or bad as it happens; for it is not likely that men of ſuch volatile looſe tempers ſhould make any laſting reſolutions, either in matters of Religion, or even in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtances whatever.</p>
            <pb n="343" facs="tcp:60424:176"/>
            <p>Ask your ſelf therefore the next day, whether you are ſtill of the ſame mind; after ſome intermiſſion put the cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to examination, after that thy mind hath been diverted by other matters, and thy thoughts employed in other affairs, ſo that the warmth of thy firſt imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is now over, try then whether thou approveſt of the ſame things: Doth not thy heart begin to ſtumble, and draw back, and ſhrink from the undertaking? doſt thou not begin to think of ſome inſtance of thy duty wherein thou deſireſt to be excuſed, or ſome ſin which thou wouldſt fain have excepted? doſt thou not han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker after a greater liberty in ſome things? if not, I know no better ſign in the world of a good reſolution, and ſuch as is like to hold out than this, when we keep the ſame mind in our different tempers, and ſeveral ſtates of life. And think not all this care too much, or too troubleſome, ſince it is neceſſary onely for a-while, till we are well ſetled and confirmed in this change, or new life. Try thy ſelf when thou art ſound and in health, as well as when under a fit of the ſtone or gout; when thou art merry and brisk, as well
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:60424:177"/>as when thou art ſad and melancholy; and if thou ſtill find'ſt reaſon to perſiſt in the ſame reſolution, thou mayſt doe well, the more to fix thy ſelf, to back it with a ſolemn vow and proteſtation to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that by his grace thou wilt keep firm and ſteadfaſt to it to the end of thy life. And it hath been farther advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that we ſhould commit this to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, keep it ſafe by us as our act and deed, by which we have devoted and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up our ſelves to God, and often reade it over, and examine our faithfulneſs to it, as that which ſhall one day be produced againſt us to our everlaſting confuſion, if we do not diſcharge and ſatisfy it. Let us alſo take the firſt occaſion to renew and confirm theſe vows and reſolutions at the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain bind thy ſelf to perform all that thou haſt promiſed; there by that ſacred body and bloud thou commemorateſt, oblige thy ſelf never to ſtart wilfully from God's ſervice, whatever difficulties thou mayſt encounter with, what temptations ſoever thou mayſt have to forſake it; and ſurely this, if any thing, is ſufficient to make us conſtant as long as any ſenſe of God or Chriſt remains in our minds.</p>
            <pb n="345" facs="tcp:60424:177"/>
            <p n="4">4. Make known this thy good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the world, be not aſhamed to own this change to other perſons, as fit occaſions may be offered: let them know that thy mind is now altered, that thou art not the ſame perſon thou wert before, that they are much miſtaken if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſame diſcourſe, the ſame compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, the ſame practices from thee as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that thou art now reſolved to ſerve thy Lord and Maſter even unto death, and never for the world to doe any thing that doth diſpleaſe him; that by the help of God, thou haſt fully determined, never to be any more falſe to thy Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that thou doſt glory in this thy unfeigned reſolution.</p>
            <p>This will hinder others from tempting thee, and make them ſee it is in vain any more to aſſault or trouble thee; nay, and it will be a mighty confirmation and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to thee, for then thou wilt have this great argument to continue true to this promiſe and engagement, leſt by breaking it, thou ſhouldſt moſt juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſport and mock to thoſe to whom thou haſt made it known, and they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60424:178"/>ſhould ſay of thee, as our Saviour ſaith of the fooliſh builder, <hi>behold this man began to build, but was not able to finiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Having fixed ſo good a purpoſe of mind, fail not to apply your ſelf to the diligent conſcientious uſe of all thoſe means of grace which God hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and appointed, for the vanquiſhing of ſin, and for the obtaining vertue and goodneſs: Many men ſuppoſe they have done enough, when they have once brought their minds to a reſolution, though they then never think more of it; they think there is piety and ſecurity ſufficient in reſolving for the end, though they never conſider nor concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the means; they look upon a good reſolution as a kind of holy charm, and if they do but intend to mend their lives, they reckon their lives will mend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without any farther pain or trouble.</p>
            <p>But ſuch had beſt try firſt what money they can get by onely reſolving to be rich, without taking any pains for it; or let them ſee whether learning will come of it ſelf, without any reading or ſtudy, to a man that onely reſolves to be learned.</p>
            <pb n="347" facs="tcp:60424:178"/>
            <p>Nothing hath done more miſchief in the world, hath made <hi>Chriſtians</hi> more lazy and ſecure, or given greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to that prevailing <hi>Religion</hi> without <hi>vertue</hi> amongſt us, than this one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that we are converted (as 'tis uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called) by thoſe operations of God's Spirit, wherein we are wholly paſſive; ſo that it is in vain to ſtrive, contend and labour for the making our ſelves holy, as we muſt doe for the attaining of any other perfections and accompliſhments, ſince the habits of all goodneſs are ſupernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infuſed into us: But this is all but fancy and idle talk, for the Spirit of God works not now a days, but according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of reaſon and diſcourſe, aſſiſting us whilſt we ſincerely uſe ſuch moral means as Religion teaches, or reaſon preſcribes, and that with as much diligence, vigour and conſtancy, as if we had no aſſiſtence at all, but were wholly left to our ſelves; ſo that the way to recover our ſelves to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> temper of mind after a vitious courſe of life, is in truth the very ſame by which a man recovers his health after a long diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by God's bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diligent uſe of fit means; and any
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60424:179"/>other way is no more now to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than prophecy or miracles.</p>
            <p>The reformation of an habitual ſinner is a work of time and patience; evil cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms muſt be maſtered and ſubdued by degrees; and we muſt be forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine particular times, and to uſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proper means for the gaining of the ſeveral graces required in a Chriſtians we muſt firſt encounter one vice or luſt, then another; and after we have done our beſt, yet perhaps a temptation may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe us unawares, and we may fall again into the mire even after we have waſhed our ſelves in ſome meaſure, and ſo create our ſelves new work and greater trouble: we muſt expect ſometimes to come off by the worſt, before we obtain the final conqueſt; and our luſts, after they have been routed, may perchance rally, and make head again.</p>
            <p>We muſt not therefore be preſently diſcouraged, or faint and grow weary in theſe our conflicts with ſin and vice; for if we can but bear undauntedly the firſt ſhock, and ſtand out the firſt aſſaults, the force of our enemies will ſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60424:179"/>we ſhall every day gain ground, the work will grow much eaſier upon our hands; and the means of grace, if we are but conſtant and unwearied in the uſe of them, will never fail of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Let us always ſecond our good reſolutions with devout prayers for the aids of God's holy Spirit to ſtrengthen us in this our undertaking; to animate us with patience and courage, to fight for us, and with us, againſt all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our ſouls; that he would furniſh us with an inward power in our minds, whereby our evil inclinations may be changed, and that by the ſtrength of his grace we may be freed from thoſe ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that formerly ſubdued us.</p>
            <p>For by this means God is not onely made an aſſiſtent, but a witneſs and a party, and our reſolutions come near to the nature of a vow; by this we daily oblige our ſelves afreſh to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our reſolutions, this adds the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtrength and ſolemnity to them; and though they were at firſt begun upon too ſlight conſiderations, or too ſuddenly or weakly made, yet when once we ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60424:180"/>make God concerned in them, they will then become firm and ſtrong: And indeed he that finds in himſelf no mind to pray to God for his aſſiſtence, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, be they what they will, are certainly vain; his neglect to implore God's aid, is a ſure ſign that he hath no mind to keep them.</p>
            <p>Often therefore proſtrate your ſelves at his footſtool, beſeech him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the day of ſmall things, not to quench the ſmoaking flax, nor to break the bruiſed reed, that he would be pleaſed to bleſs and proſper theſe beginnings and firſt attempts towards a new life; profeſs your dependence upon his help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and beg of him moſt earneſtly never to leave you, nor forſake you.</p>
            <p>And if thus reſolved, thus truſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's grace, thus diligent in the uſe of all due means, we yet fail of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming our ſins and luſts; I ſhall then readily confeſs, that there is but little heed to be given to the promiſes of the Goſpel, that our miſery is unavoidable, and that God hath not provided a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient remedy for ſinners: but therefore
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60424:180"/>it is onely that we ſo often fall ſhort, and find temptations too hard for all our good purpoſes, becauſe we reſolve but by halves, and unadviſedly, we reſolve we know not what, we doe it raſhly or ſillily, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſomely, upon no reaſons, or none that will hold. This is the ſecond hindrance of mens repentance, the unſuccesfulneſs of former reſolutions, which ought to be laid onely at our own door, and charged upon our ſelves as our own fault.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another great hindrance of mens repentance is the hope of long life, and better opportunity of repenting hereafter. And indeed of all the Devil's artifices to keep men off from amending their lives, this is that which prevails moſt, and with moſt men, they content themſelves with a repentance in reverſion, and continually poſtpone this one thing neceſſary; After this or that buſineſs is diſpatched, this or that luſt ſatisfied, this or that turn ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when their bodies are as infirm as their ſouls, then they will take care of both together. If you look abroad into the world, you will find this is that by which chiefly wicked men maintain the quiet and peace of their minds; for they
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:60424:181"/>cannot endure to think of paſſing out of this life, and appearing before God in an impenitent ſtate; but their full purpoſe is to doe ſomething, ſome time or other, they cannot well tell what nor when, by which they hope to make ſome amends for all their former follies and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
            <p>This therefore is our moſt difficult task, not ſo much to perſuade men of the neceſſity of repentance, as to prevail with them unalterably to fix a time when this change ſhall begin, and the care of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion take place: we find it moſt hard to convince them that it is neceſſary now at this very preſent to ſet about it: we are thought a little too hot and haſty, when we preſs wicked men to leave their ſins <hi>to day; even whilſt it is called to day,</hi> as long as they have ſo much time before them to doe it in. This is the moſt fatal cheat men put upon themſelves, ſo that I doubt not to ſay, that the infernal regions of darkneſs and deſpair are not crowded by any ſort of perſons ſo much as by thoſe who fully deſigned and intended to have repented before they died.</p>
            <pb n="353" facs="tcp:60424:181"/>
            <p>It were eaſie now at large to ſhew the infinite unreaſonableneſs and danger of ſuch delay; but I ſhall content my ſelf with propounding to you theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if we be unwilling to repent now, it is not likely that we ſhall be more willing at any other time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if we think our ſelves not able to doe it now, we ſhall be leſs able here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If we be unwilling to repent and amend now, it is not likely that we ſhall be more willing or inclined to it at any other time: for the ſame reaſon that makes any man defer it now, will be as forcible and prevalent at another time. Since the man hath found no great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience from the ſins of the laſt week or month, he ſees not why he may not as well venture on them for another, and after that he ſays he will certainly become a new man; but when that time comes, yet ſtill God continues his patience, and is not weary of bearing with him, ſo that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:60424:182"/>he'll think he may ſtill venture to put it off once more, and then he will not fail to perform his good intentions of amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his life.</p>
            <p>And this is moſt probably the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch vain purpoſes of leaving our ſins hereafter; for the onely objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have againſt doing it now, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this time is preſent, and we are loth as yet to put our ſelves to ſo much trouble and pain as this work doth require; and therefore when to morrow is as this day, and comes to be preſent too, we ſhall for the ſame reaſon for which we defer it till then, put it off ſtill to another day, and ſo it will be always a day or more to that day when we ſhall begin to repent.</p>
            <p>So that this ought rather to be called a full purpoſe of committing ſin to day, than a reſolution of leaving it to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: he that reſolves to be vertuous, but not till ſome time hereafter, reſolves againſt being vertuous in the mean time; and as vertue at ſuch a diſtance is eaſily reſolved on, ſo it is as eaſie a matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to keep it at that diſtance: the next week, ſays the ſinner, I will begin to be
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:60424:182"/>ſober and temperate, ſerious and devout; but the true ſenſe of what he ſays, is this, I am fully bent to ſpend this preſent week in riot and exceſs, in ſenſuality and prophaneneſs, or whatever vice it is that I indulge my ſelf in; and if we doe thus often, if it be our common courſe to put off our repentance thus from time to time, this is a moſt ſhrewd ſign, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we never intend to repent at all: This is onely a pitifull device and excuſe to ſhift off the duty wholly; and ſo we ſhould interpret it in any man who ſhould deal with us after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in our worldly affairs.</p>
            <p>It is with wicked men in this caſe, as it is with a bankrupt, when his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours are loud and clamorous, ſpeak big and threaten high, he giveth them many good words and fair promiſes, appoints them to come another day, entreats their patience but a little longer, and then he will ſatisfy them all; when yet the man really intends not to pay one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor ever thinks of compaſſing the money againſt the time: Thus do men endeavour to pacify and quiet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, by telling them they will hear
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:60424:183"/>them another time; but this is onely to delude and cheat their conſciences with good words, and ſpecious pretences, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them believe, they will certainly doe, what yet they cannot endure to think of, and what they would fain wholly excuſe themſelves from; but yet this is not all, for</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We ſhall be leſs able to repent, and more indiſpoſed for the work at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time than we are now. That which makes men ſo loth to be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon their lives paſt, is (as I before obſerved) the uneaſineſs and trouble they think they ſhall find in ſuch a work; ſo a great Trader, that hath good reaſon to think he is run much behind-hand in the world, of all things hates to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Books, cannot endure to hear of ſtating his accounts, and yet the longer he defers this, his accounts will become more intricate, he'll ſtill run more in debt, his condition will every day grow worſe and worſe, till at laſt 'tis paſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: and thus it is with wicked men, they would fain defer their repentance as long as ever they can, they would not yet be interrupted with ſuch grave and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:60424:183"/>ſerious thoughts; but the miſchief is, the longer they defer it, the more they have ſtill to repent of; and not onely ſo, but they become more unable and unfit for ſuch a work; they are ſtill more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and averſe, as having been longer uſed and accuſtomed to their ſins, and as having contracted greater familiarity with, and kindneſs for them; and by ſuch delay their ill habits grow more confirmed, their luſts and paſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtronger and more potent, and even their very natural powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are by degrees weakned and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
            <p>And for this reaſon, the ſooner we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a religious courſe of life, the more eaſie it will prove to us, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the time of youth we are moſt capable of any impreſſions, our natures being then moſt ſoft and tender, but alſo becauſe if we begin betimes, there is ſo much the leſs change to be made in our lives and tempers, our repentance then is like a man's returning into the right road as ſoon as ever he was out of his way, he hath but a few paces to go back.</p>
            <pb n="358" facs="tcp:60424:184"/>
            <p>You therefore who have not yet loſt all your natural modeſty, who yet bluſh at your vices, whoſe hearts are not yet hardned in ſin, would you but preſently without any delay, apply your ſelves to the ſervice of God, and practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, what abundance of care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble might you ſave your ſelves? how many ſad days and ſorrowfull nights might you prevent? it is in your power now upon eaſie terms to become good and vertuous, and the ſooner you begin, the leſs ſorrow, the leſs ſelf-denial, the leſs pains will ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, even this very day let us ſet about it, and he that hath done wickedly, let him not dare to doe the ſame ſo much as once more; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve never to have any parley with our luſts, but to make ſome conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in our repentance, before ever we give ſleep to our eyes, or ſlumber to our eyelids; let not any worldly buſineſs, or the cares of this life, or even our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary employments, much leſs ſinfull and vain pleaſures, ſtifle or choak any good thoughts or reſolutions, that, during this
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:60424:184"/>exerciſe, may be raiſed in our minds: we have trifled too long already about a matter of ſuch infinite moment, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect madneſs to dally any longer, when our ſouls, which are ten thouſand times more worth than our lives, are at ſtake: If we begin this very moment, God knows, we begin late enough, and who knows but to morrow may be too late? had we been wiſe we ſhould have begun ſooner.</p>
            <p>A long and eternal adieu therefore (let us every one ſay) to all the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bewitching pleaſures of this world, I will no longer be fooled or impoſed upon by them, nor one day more live in ſuch a ſtate, as I ſhall be afraid to die in: from this hour I change my ſervice, I now lay my ſelf down at the feet of my bleſſed Maſter; without any farther diſputing the caſe, I will immediately begin my journey to my father's houſe; I will as ſoon defer eating, drinking or ſleeping, as delay to ſecure my everlaſting ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to become ſound and healthfull, to be at eaſe and in peace, to be ſafe and happy.</p>
            <pb n="360" facs="tcp:60424:185"/>
            <p>And for our encouragement to this, I ſhall onely, for the concluſion of all, add, that however great and heinous our ſins have been, yet we cannot be more ready to ask, than God is to grant us our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; we cannot be more forward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, than he is to receive us into his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces. And becauſe we know our ſelves obnoxious to his ſevere juſtice, and that he is a God of truth and faithfulneſs, as well as of mercy and compaſſion, and that he hateth ſin with a perfect hatred; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we might not have the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion remaining in us of his unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to forgive ſuch high provocations and offences as we may have been guilty of, he hath been pleaſed to ſend his onely begotten Son into the world, to lay down his life a ranſome for us, to ſtand between us and God's juſtice, and by his diſmal ſufferings and curſed death to expiate our offences: ſo that we have not onely the infinite goodneſs of the divine nature to truſt to, but the vertue and efficacy of that ſacrifice which the Son of God made of himſelf, to plead for our forgiveneſs, upon our repentance and amendment.</p>
            <pb n="361" facs="tcp:60424:185"/>
            <p>Nor was our bleſſed Saviour onely our propitiation to die for us, and procure our attonement, but he is ſtill our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, continually interceding with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the behalf of all true penitents, and ſuing out their pardon for them in the Court of Heaven: <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> who deprecates anger, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigates wrath; and not onely barely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for us, but with authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the releaſe of his captives, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his bloud, by virtue of God's promiſe and covenant.</p>
            <p>And in order to the ſufficient promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this his gratious willingneſs to forgive us upon our repentance, God hath provided and appointed an order of men, to laſt as long as the world doth, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to men this bleſſed overture, and in God's name <hi>to beſeech men to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay God condeſcends to prevent the worſt of men, by manifold bleſſings and favours daily obliging them, by his grace and ſpirit and ſeveral providences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:60424:186"/>them, moving, affecting and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening the moſt grievous offenders to a timely conſideration of their ways. Though highly provoked, he yet begins firſt with us, ſo deſirous is he of our welfare.</p>
            <p>He hath not onely outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed pardon to all that will ſubmit, and ſent his own Son on this meſſage of peace, but inwardly, by his ſpirit and grace, he ſolicites men to comply with it, even where it is reſiſted and deſpiſed; he forſaketh not men at their firſt denial, he giveth them time to bethink and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect themſelves; he doth not lie at the catch, nor take preſent advantage againſt us, but with infinite patience waits to be gratious to us, hoping at laſt we ſhall be of a better mind: he doth not ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of mens converſion and reformation, he yet extends his grace towards thoſe who abuſe it, and offers his pardon to thoſe who ſlight it; nothing is more highly pleaſing and acceptable to him, than for a ſinner to return from the evil of his ways; nay, which is more yet, he is not onely, upon our repentance, ready to overlook all that is paſt, but he hath
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60424:186"/>promiſed to reward our future obedience with eternal life, ſo that we ſhall not onely upon our repentance be freed from thoſe diſmal puniſhments which we had rendred our ſelves liable to, but likewiſe receive from God ſuch a glorious recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, as is beyond all our conception or imagination. Now if ſuch love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heaven towards us will not beget ſome relentings and remorſe in us, if ſuch powerfull arguments will not prevail with us to grow wiſe and conſiderate, it is impoſſible any ſhould.</p>
            <p>Let us all therefore ſmite upon our breaſts, and ſay, O Lord, we are highly ſenſible of our folly, of our unworthineſs and foul ingratitude; for we have ſinned againſt thee, and done evil in thy ſight, and are no more worthy to be called thy children: but we have heard that the great King of the World is a moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King, that he delights not in the death of ſinners, but had rather they ſhould repent and live: we cannot lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger withſtand or oppoſe ſuch unſpeakable goodneſs, we are overcome by ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull kindneſs and condeſcention, we reſign up our ſelves wholly to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60424:187"/>of his good ſpirit, and will never withdraw or alienate our ſelves from him any more; we will now become God's true and loyal ſubjects, and continue ſuch as long as we breathe, nor ſhall any thing in the world be able to ſhake or corrupt our faith and allegiance to him.</p>
            <p>What puniſhment can be too ſore, what ſtate black and diſmal enough for thoſe who contemn all theſe offers and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Heaven? who will not by any means be won, to look after, and have mercy upon themſelves, to conſult their own intereſt and welfare? what pity can they expect, who obſtinately chuſe to be miſerable, in deſpite of all the goodneſs of God, and grace of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>The Lord grant, that we may all in this our day, know and mind the things that belong to our everlaſting peace, before they are hid from our eyes.</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle having in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter moſt firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed the truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Saviour's reſurrection from the dead, proceeds to infer from thence the certainty of our own reſurrection, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Now if Chriſt be preached that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you that there is no reſurrection of the dead? But if there be no reſurrection of the dead, then is not Chriſt riſen.</hi> 
               <q>It cannot now any longer ſeem an impoſſible or incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible thing to you that God ſhould raiſe the dead, ſince you have ſo plain and undoubted an example of it in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our bleſſed Lord, who having been truly dead and buried, is now
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:60424:188"/>alive, and hath appeared unto many with the viſible marks of his crucifixion ſtill remaining in his body.</q> And to ſhew of what general concernment his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was, <hi>the graves were opened,</hi> as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, <hi>and many bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the graves after his reſurrection, and appeared unto many;</hi> the ſame power <hi>which raiſed Jeſus from the dead,</hi> is able alſo to <hi>quicken our mortal bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in my Text the Apoſtle brings in ſome <hi>ſceptical</hi> perſon objecting againſt this doctrine of the reſurrection of the dead, <hi>But ſome man will ſay, how are the dead raiſed up? and with what body do they come?</hi> Two queſtions that every one almoſt is ready to ſtart, eſpecially thoſe who love to cavil at Religion; and it hath not a little puzled ſuch as have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to give a rational account of our faith to give a full and ſatisfactory anſwer to them. <q>
                  <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> How is it poſſible that thoſe bodies ſhould be raiſed again, and joined to the ſouls which formerly inhabited them, which many thouſand years ago were either buried in the Earth, or
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:60424:188"/>ſwallowed up in the Sea, or devoured by fire; which have been diſſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſmalleſt atoms, and thoſe ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over the face of the earth, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed as far aſunder as the Heaven is wide; nay which have undergone ten thouſand ſeveral changes and tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, have fructified the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the nouriſhment of other animals, and thoſe the food again of other men, and ſo have been adopted into ſeveral other bodies? How is it poſſible that all thoſe little particles which made up, ſuppoſe, the body of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhould at the end of the world be again ranged and marſhalled together, and unmixt from the duſt of other bodies, be all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, into the ſame order, figure and poſture they were before, ſo as to make the very ſelf-ſame fleſh and bloud which his ſoul at his diſſolution forſook? This ſeems a <hi>Camel</hi> too big for any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſon to ſwallow: he muſt be of a very eaſie faith who can digeſt ſuch impoſſibilities. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> indeed, when <hi>the hand of the Lord was upon him,</hi> and <hi>he was carried out in the ſpirit of the Lord,</hi> thought he was <hi>ſet down in the midſt of a valley full of dry bones;</hi> and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60424:189"/>that afterwards he <hi>heard a noiſe, and behold a ſhaking,</hi> and <hi>the bones came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, bone to his bone, the ſinews and the fleſh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above; and the breath came into them, and they lived and ſtood upon their feet.</hi> This may paſs well enough in a Prophetical Viſion, and did hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely repreſent the wonderfull reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People; But that all this and much more ſhould in truth come to paſs, that our bones after they are reſolved into duſt, ſhould really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come living men; that all the little atoms whereof our bodies conſiſted, howſoever ſcattered, or whereſoever lodged, ſhould immediately at a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſummons rally and meet again, and every one challenge and poſſeſs its own proper place, till at laſt the whole rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fabrick be perfectly rebuilt, and that of the very ſelf-ſame ſtuff and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials whereof it conſiſted before its fall; that this, I ſay, ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be effected, is ſuch an incredible thing, that it ſeems to be above the power of reaſon ſo much as to frame a conception of it.</q> And therefore we may obſerve that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did moſt
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:60424:189"/>eſpecially boggle at this Article of our <hi>Chriſtian faith,</hi> as we reade in the 17th of the <hi>Acts:</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Athenians</hi> concerning the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dead, the Philoſophers moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at him, and entertained his doctrine with nothing but ſcoffs and flouts; and indeed it was one of the laſt things that the <hi>Heathens</hi> received into their belief; and it is to this day the chiefeſt objection againſt <hi>Chriſtianity. How are the dead raiſed up? and with what body do they come?</hi> In my diſcourſe of theſe words I ſhall doe theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall ſhew that the reſurrection of the dead, even in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as it is commonly underſtood and explained of the very ſelf-ſame body that died and was buried, contains nothing in it impoſſible or incredible.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Since it is certain that the body which we ſhall riſe with, though it may be as to ſubſtance the ſame with our ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial body, yet will be ſo much altered and changed in its modes and qualities, that it will be quite another kind of body from what it was before; I ſhall give you
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:60424:190"/>a ſhort account of the difference the Scripture makes between a glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and this mortal fleſh. And</p>
            <p n="3">III. Laſtly, I ſhall draw ſome practical inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall ſhew that the reſurrection of the dead, even in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as it is commonly underſtood and explained of the very ſelf-ſame body that died and was buried, contains nothing in it impoſſible or incredible.</p>
            <p>Whether this ſtrict ſenſe of the Article be the true or not, I think I need not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; it is ſufficient for me to ſhew, that if this be the true ſenſe of it, yet the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt</hi> or <hi>Sceptick</hi> hath nothing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to object againſt it, but what is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a fair and eaſie anſwer. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever give me leave juſt to lay before you ſome of the principal reaſons and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon which it is built and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. I think it muſt be acknowledged that this hath been all along the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon received opinion amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:60424:190"/>that at the laſt day we ſhall riſe again with the very ſame fleſh with which we are clothed in this ſtate, and which we put off at our death: and that our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies will not onely conſiſt of the ſame ſubſtance and matter with our earthly, but will be of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency and modification, perfect fleſh and bloud, though in ſome properties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and changed. Moſt of the ancient Fathers of the Church (excepting ſome few that were of a more inquiſitive tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and philoſophical genius than the reſt, as <hi>Origen</hi> and ſome others) did believe and teach, that at the general reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion men ſhould he reſtored to the very ſame bodies which they dwelt in here, and which at laſt were laid in the grave: that their bodies ſhould be then as truly the ſame with thoſe they died in, as the bodies of thoſe whom our Saviour raiſed when he was upon earth were the ſame with thoſe they had before; that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body ſhould be raiſed but that which ſlept, and that as our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> aroſe with his former fleſh and bones and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſo we alſo after the reſurrection ſhould have the ſame members we now uſe, the ſame fleſh and bloud and bones.</p>
            <pb n="372" facs="tcp:60424:191"/>
            <p>And that this was the common belief and expectation of all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, that they ſhould appear again at the general reſurrection with the very ſame bodies they lived in here on earth, will appear from that ſpite and malice which the <hi>Heathens</hi> ſometimes ſhewed to the dead bodies of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> reducing them to aſhes, and then ſcattering them into the air, or throwing them into ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that thereby they might defeat and deprive them of all hopes of a reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: of this <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives us an eminent inſtance out of the Epiſtle of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> to thoſe in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> under the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of <hi>Antoninus Verus;</hi> which gives an account, how that the <hi>Heathens,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many vain and fruitleſs attempts to ſuppreſs the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> by inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the crueleſt torments on the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of it, which they bravely endured, looking for a joyfull reſurrection; at laſt thought of a way to deprive them, as they fondly imagined, of that great hope which miniſtred ſo much joy and courage to them under the ſevereſt trials; which was by reducing the wrackt and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:60424:191"/>bodies of the ſeveral <hi>Martyrs</hi> into the minuteſt <hi>Atoms,</hi> and then ſcattering them in the great River <hi>Rhodanus. Let us now,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſee whether they can riſe again, and whether their God can help them, and deliver them out of our hands.</hi> Now this is a ſufficient intimation to us, that it was then the known common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the very ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and fleſh which ſuffered and was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred here on earth, ſhould be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the laſt day. And indeed thoſe amongſt the <hi>Ancient Chriſtians</hi> who have undertaken to defend or explain this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the reſurrection of the dead, do it moſtly by ſuch principles, arguments and illuſtrations, as do ſuppoſe the very ſame body and fleſh and members to be raiſed again, which the ſoul animated here in this life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This hath not onely been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon received opinion of Chriſtians, but alſo the moſt plain and eaſie notion of a reſurrection ſeems to require it; namely, that the very ſame body which died ſhould be raiſed again. Nothing dies but the body, nothing is corrupted but the body; the ſoul goeth upward, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:60424:192"/>to God, and therefore nothing elſe can be properly ſaid to be raiſed again, but onely that very body which died and was corrupted. If God give to our ſouls at the laſt day a new body, this cannot literally be called the reſurrection of our bodies, becauſe here is no reproduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame thing that was before, which ſeems to be plainly implied in the word <hi>reſurrection.</hi> Indeed the word is ſometimes uſed otherwiſe, as when a Houſe or Temple that hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by fire, is rebuilt on the ſame ground where it formerly ſtood, this is often, though improperly and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively called the reſurrection of it, and after the ſame manner do the <hi>Latines</hi> uſe the word <hi>reſurgere;</hi> but yet the moſt proper and literal ſignification of the word <hi>reſurrection,</hi> is, that the ſame fleſh which was ſeparated from the ſoul at the day of death ſhould be again vitally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are many places of Scripture which in their ſtrict and literal meaning do ſeem plainly to favour this ſenſe of the Article, that the very ſame fleſh ſhall be raiſed again; what more plain and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:60424:192"/>expreſs, ſaith St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> than that of <hi>Job? Job</hi> 19.26, 27. <hi>Though after my skin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and my eyes ſhall behold, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But however plain theſe words may ſeem to be, yet I cannot think that the primary and original meaning of them doth at all relate to the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor were they ever ſo underſtood and interpreted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us; not but that they might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical of it, and ſo by way of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation may be fitly applied to it; but the firſt and moſt eaſie ſenſe of the words ſeems to be this: <q>After my skin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, let that which remains of me likewiſe by piecemeals be deſtroyed, yet I am confident that, before I die, with theſe very eyes I ſhall ſee my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and be reſtored by him to my former happy ſtate.</q> So that the words are a plain prophecy of his own delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and an high expreſſion of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident hope in God, that in time he would vindicate his innocence, and bring him out of all his troubles. But if this place will not hold, there are others in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of the ſame importance.</p>
            <pb n="376" facs="tcp:60424:193"/>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 53d verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſpeaking of our body, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious change it ſhall undergo at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, tells us, that <hi>this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall put on immortality;</hi> now by this <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> and this <hi>mortal</hi> can onely be meant that body which we now carry about with us, and ſhall one day lay down in the duſt. Thus alſo the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>He that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken our mortal bodies.</hi> Now that which ſhall be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and raiſed to life again, can be nothing elſe but that very body of fleſh which is mortal, and died: though there is ſome queſtion to be made, whether the <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our mortal bodies by the ſpirit of Chriſt dwelling in us,</hi> ſhould not rather be underſtood in a <hi>metaphorical</hi> or moral ſenſe, of the firſt reſurrection from the death of ſin to the life of righteouſneſs, than of the general reſurrection at the conſummation of all things.</p>
            <p>But farther, the mention and deſcription the Scripture makes of the places from whence the dead ſhall riſe, doth ſeem plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:60424:193"/>to intimate, that the ſame bodies which were dead, ſhall revive again. Thus we reade in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 12. v. 2. <hi>That thoſe that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting death.</hi> Where we may yet farther obſerve, that the Metaphor of <hi>ſleeping</hi> and <hi>awaking,</hi> by which our death and reſurrection is here expreſſed, doth ſeem to imply, that when we riſe again, our bodies will be as much the ſame with thoſe we lived in, as they are when we awake, the ſame with thoſe we had before we laid our ſelves down to ſleep. Thus again it is ſaid in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſes</hi> 28, and 29. <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth; they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the reſurrection of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Chap. 20. verſe 13. <hi>And the ſea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell,</hi> that is, the grave, <hi>delivered up the dead that were in them, and they were judged every man according to their works.</hi> Now if the ſame fleſh ſhall not be raiſed again, what need is there of ranſacking the graves at
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:60424:194"/>the end of the word? the Sea can give up no other bodies but the ſame which it received in; nor can the Grave deliver up any, but onely thoſe that were laid therein: if it were not neceſſary that we ſhould riſe with the very ſame bodies, the graves need not be opened, but our fleſh might be permitted to reſt there for ever. To this may be added, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in the 3d <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> verſe 21. that our Saviour <hi>ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body.</hi> Now this vile <hi>body</hi> can be no other than this fleſh and bloud which we are now cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with, reſtored to life again.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we conſider the ſeveral inſtances and examples either of thoſe who did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſcend up into Heaven, or of thoſe who after death were reſtored to life again, they all ſeem plainly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this opinion, that at the laſt day we ſhall riſe again with the very ſame fleſh and bloud which we had here. <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> of old were tranſlated into Heaven in their terreſtrial bodies; and therefore may be ſuppoſed now to live there with the ſame fleſh and parts they
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60424:194"/>had when they were here upon earth. And thoſe three that were raiſed from the dead in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and thoſe that were recalled to life by our Saviour, or accompanied him at his reſurrection, all appeared again in the very ſame bodies they had before their diſſolution: and theſe were examples and types of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reſurrection, and therefore our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection muſt reſemble theirs, and we alſo muſt appear at the laſt day with the ſame bodies we lived in here. Even our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, who was the <hi>firſt fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> did raiſe his own body, according to that prediction of his. <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will build it up again.</hi> Nay he appeared to his Diſciples with the very prints of the nails in his hands and feet, and with all the other marks of his crucifixion; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my hands and my feet,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that it is I my ſelf; Handle me, and ſee, for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have:</hi> from whence it ſeems to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that we in our reſurrection ſhall be conformable to our Saviour, and reſume the very ſame bodies that were laid in the Sepulchre.</p>
            <pb n="380" facs="tcp:60424:195"/>
            <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, It is farther urged by ſome of the <hi>Ancients</hi> for a proof of the reſurrection of the ſame body, that the exact juſtice and righteouſneſs of God doth require it; that God's juſtice, I mean that which conſiſts in the equal diſpenſation of rewards and puniſhments, will ſeem to be much obſcured, at leaſt will not be ſo illuſtriouſly manifeſted and diſplayed to the world, unleſs the ſame body of fleſh be raiſed again; that ſo that which was here the conſtant partner with the ſoul in all her actions, whether good or evil, may alſo hereafter ſhare with her in her rewards or puniſhments. It ſeems but equal that we ſhould be puniſhed in the ſame body in which we ſinned; and that that very fleſh in which we pleaſed God ſhould be exalted and glorified at the laſt day, and receive a juſt recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for all the trouble and hardſhip it underwent in this life.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a brief account of this ſtricteſt ſenſe of the Article of the Reſurrection, namely, that the very ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame leſh and bloud which make up our bodies here on earth, ſhall be raiſed again at
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:60424:195"/>the laſt day; and after it hath been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and glorified by the power and ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (I ſpeak onely of the bodies of good men) ſhall aſcend up into Heaven, and there live and dwell for ever in the preſence of God. I come now to ſhew that there is nothing in all this impoſſible or incredible: which I ſhall do by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is poſſible for God to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and diſtinguiſh and preſerve unmixt from all other bodies the particular duſt and <hi>atoms</hi> into which the ſeveral bodies of men are diſſolved, and to recollect and unite them together how far ſoever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed aſunder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God can form that duſt ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected together, of which the body did formerly conſiſt, into the ſame body it was before. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. That when he hath made this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he can enliven it, and make it the ſame living man, by uniting it to the ſame ſoul and ſpirit that uſed formerly to inhabit there. It cannot be denied, but that theſe three things do expreſs the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:60424:196"/>whole of the reſurrection of our fleſh in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, and none of theſe are impoſſible.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God can obſerve and diſtinguiſh and preſerve unmixt from all other bodies the particular duſt and <hi>atoms</hi> into which the ſeveral bodies of men are diſſolved, and recollect and unite them together, how far ſoever diſperſed aſunder. God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in wiſedom, power and knowledge, he <hi>knoweth the number of the ſtars, and calleth them all by their names; he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the waters in the hollow of his hand, and metes out the heavens with a ſpan, and comprehends the duſt of the earth in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; he numbers the hairs of our head, and not ſo much as a ſparrow falls to the ground without his knowledge:</hi> he can tell the number of the ſands of the Seaſhore, as the Heathens uſed to expreſs the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of his knowledge; and is it at all incredible that ſuch an infinite underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhould diſtinctly know the ſeveral particles of duſt into which the bodies of men are mouldred, and plainly diſcern to whom they belong, and obſerve the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious changes they undergo in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through ſeveral bodies? Why ſhould
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:60424:196"/>it be thought ſtrange, that he who at firſt formed us, <hi>whoſe eyes did ſee our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance yet being imperfect, and in whoſe book all our members were written; from whom our ſubſtance was not hid, when we were made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the earth,</hi> ſhould know every part of our bodies, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry atome whereof they are compoſed? The curious artiſt knows every pin and part of the Watch or Machine which he frames, and if the little Engine ſhould fall in pieces, and all the parts of it lie in the greateſt diſorder and confuſion, yet he can ſoon rally them together, and as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſtinguiſh one from another, as if every one had its particular mark; he knows the uſe of every part, can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſign to each its proper place, and exactly diſpoſe them into the ſame figure and order they were in before: and can we think that the <hi>Almighty Architect</hi> of the world, whoſe workmanſhip we are, doth not know whereof we are made, or is not acquainted with the ſeveral parts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of which this earthly tabernacle of ours is framed and compoſed? The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral corporeal beings that now conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute this Univerſe, at the firſt creation of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60424:197"/>the world lay all confuſed in a vaſt heap of rude and indigeſted <hi>Chaos;</hi> till by the voice of the Omnipotent they were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one from the other, and framed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe diſtinct bodies, whereof this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and orderly world doth conſiſt: and why may not the ſame power at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all things, out of the ruines and rubbiſh of the world, collect the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reliques of our corrupted bodies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them each to their proper places, and reſtore them to their primitive ſhapes and figures, and frame them into the ſame individual bodies they were parts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? All the atoms and particles into which mens bodies are at laſt diſſolved, however they may ſeem to us to lie care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly ſcattered over the face of the earth, yet are ſafely lodged by God's wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal in ſeveral receptacles and repoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries till the day of reſtitution of all things; <hi>in aquis, in ignibus, in alitibus, in beſtiis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> they are preſerved in <hi>the waters,</hi> in <hi>birds</hi> and <hi>beaſts,</hi> till the ſound of the laſt trumpet ſhall ſummon them, and recall them all to their former habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <pb n="385" facs="tcp:60424:197"/>
            <p>But the chiefeſt and moſt uſual objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt what I am now pleading for is this, That it may ſometimes happen that ſeveral mens bodies may conſiſt of the very ſelf-ſame matter: for the bodies of men are oftentimes devoured by beaſts and fiſhes, and other animals, and the fleſh of theſe is afterwards eaten by other men, and becomes part of their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till at laſt the ſame particles of matter come to belong to ſeveral bodies; and it is impoſſible that at the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ſhould be united to them all. Or to expreſs it ſhorter, it is reported of ſome whole Nations, that they devour the bodies of other men, and feed upon humane fleſh; ſo that theſe muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily borrow great part of their bodies of other men: and if that which was part of one man's body, comes afterwards to be part of another man's, how can both riſe at the laſt day with the very ſelf-ſame bodies they had here? But to this it may be eaſily replied, that but a very ſmall and inconſiderable part of that which is eaten, and deſcends into the ſtomach, turns into nouriſhment; the far greater part goes away by excretions
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:60424:198"/>and perſpirations. So that it is not at all impoſſible but that God Almighty, who watcheth over all things by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and governs them by his power, may ſo order the matter, that what is really part of one man's body, though eaten by another, yet ſhall never come to be part of his nouriſhment; or elſe, if it doth nouriſh him, and conſequently becomes part of his body, that it ſhall wear off again, and ſometime before his death be divided and ſeparated from it, that ſo it may remain in a condition to be reſtored to him who firſt laid it down in the duſt. And the like may be ſaid of <hi>Men-eaters,</hi> if any ſuch there be, that God by his wiſe providence may take care, either that they ſhall not be at all nouriſhed by other mens fleſh which they ſo inhumanely devour, or if they be nouriſhed by it, and ſome particles of matter, which formerly belonged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, be adopted into their bodies, yet that they ſhall yield them up again before they die, that they may be in a capacity of being reſtored at the laſt day to their right owners.</p>
            <pb n="387" facs="tcp:60424:198"/>
            <p>But perhaps it may ſeem to ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of God, and beneath his divine Majeſty, to attend to ſuch little things, and to concern himſelf about ſuch mean and trivial matters; or inconſiſtent with his eaſe and happineſs, to trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch a perplext and intricate buſineſs, as curiouſly to mark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the particles of duſt into which the ſeveral bodies of men are diſſolved, and exactly to diſtinguiſh one from another, and to preſerve them entire and unmixt, and at laſt to reſtore them all to their old bodies. But ſuch perſons ſhould have a care, leſt under pretence of pleading for God's honour and glory, they really leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him, and derogate from all his other perfections. It is the great excellency and perfection of the divine providence that it extends it ſelf to all, even to the leaſt things, and that nothing is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from its care and influence. And to fanſie that to govern the world is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to God, is ſurely to entertain mean and unworthy conceptions of him, and to judge of him by the ſame rules and meaſures we do of our ſelves. It is very unreaſonable, becauſe we are of ſuch
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:60424:199"/>weak and frail natures, as that a little bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and employment preſently tires us, to think the ſame of God Almighty, as if it were any trouble to him, or at all interrupted his infinite pleaſure and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to take care of the world, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and manage the ſeveral affairs of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of this duſt, thus preſerved and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected together, God can eaſily re-make and rebuild the very ſame bodies which were diſſolved. And that this is poſſible muſt be acknowledged by all that believe the hiſtory of the creation of the world, that God formed the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> of the duſt of the ground: if the body of man be duſt after death, it is no other than what it was originally; and the ſame power that at firſt made it of duſt, may as eaſily re-make it when it is reduced into the ſame duſt again.</p>
            <p>Nay this is no more wonderfull than the formation of an humane body in the womb, which is a thing that we have daily experience of, which without doubt is as great a miracle, and as ſtrange an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the divine power, as the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of it can poſſibly be: and were it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:60424:199"/>not ſo common and uſual a thing, we ſhould as hardly be brought to believe it poſſible, that ſuch a beautifull fabrick as the body of a man is, with nerves and bones and fleſh and veins and bloud, and the ſeveral other parts whereof it conſiſts, ſhould be raiſed out of thoſe principles of which we ſee it is made, as now we are, that hereafter it ſhould be rebuilt, when it is crumbled into duſt. Had we onely heard or read of the wonderfull forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body of man, we ſhould have been as ready to ask, <hi>how are men made? and with what bodies are they born?</hi> as now we are, when we hear of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>How are the dead raiſed up? and with what bodies do they come?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When God hath raiſed again the ſame body out of the duſt into which it was diſſolved, he can enliven it, and make it the ſame living man, by uniting it to the ſame ſoul and ſpirit which uſed formerly to inhabit there. And this we cannot with the leaſt ſhew of reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend impoſſible to be done, becauſe we muſt grant that it hath been already often done. We have ſeveral undoubted exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it in thoſe whom the Prophets of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:60424:200"/>old, and our bleſſed Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles raiſed from the dead. Nay our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf, after he was dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, roſe again, and appeared alive unto his Diſciples and others, and was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known and owned by thoſe who had accompanied him, and converſed with him for many years together, and that not preſently, but after long doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and heſitation, upon undeniable conviction and proof, that he was the very ſame perſon they had ſeen expiring upon the Croſs.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to ſhew you that in the ſtricteſt notion of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection there is nothing that is abſurd or impoſſible, or above the power of ſuch an infinite being as God is. The onely thing I know of that can with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reaſon be objected againſt what I have diſcourſed upon this head, is this, that this way of arguing from God's om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency is very fallacious, and hath been often much abuſed: for under this pretence that nothing is impoſſible to an infinits power, all the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> and <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Fables, or, which are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, all the <hi>Popiſh Legends</hi> may be
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:60424:200"/>obtruded on us for <hi>Anthentick Hiſtories;</hi> ſince there is nothing contained in them that is abſolutely above or beyond God's power to effect, if he pleaſes to exert it. Whence ſome of the <hi>Fathers</hi> have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Omnipotency of God was the great ſanctuary of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to which they always betook themſelves when they were baffled by reaſon. And indeed ſo much is certainly true, that God's Omnipotency alone is no good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove the truth of any thing; for without doubt there are an infinite number of things which are poſſible to be done or made, which yet God in his infinite wiſedom never thought fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his power about, nor perhaps ever will: and therefore we ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, becauſe God can raiſe us again with the very ſame bodies we have here; that therefore he will doe ſo. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that God hath expreſly revealed and declared that he will doe it, from the conſideration of his infinite power, we are bound (however impoſſible it may ſeem to us, ſo long as it doth not plainly imply a contradiction) not to doubt of the truth of it, but firmly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he that hath promiſed, can
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:60424:201"/>alſo perform. We muſt firſt therefore be aſſured that it is the will of God to raiſe again the ſame fleſh which was laid in the grave, and then we may ſafely have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Omnipotency of God to confirm and eſtabliſh our faith of it.</p>
            <p>I conclude this head therefore with that queſtion of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.8. <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible with you that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</hi> The change from death to life is not ſo great as that from nothing into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if we believe that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the word of his power at firſt made the heavens and the earth of no pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent matter, what reaſon have we to doubt, but that the ſame God <hi>by that mighty power whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf,</hi> can alſo raiſe to life again thoſe who were formerly alive, and have not yet wholly ceaſed to be. And though we cannot anſwer all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and objections which the wit of men (whoſe intereſt it is that their ſouls ſhould die with their bodies, and both periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) hath found out to puzzle this doctrine with: though we cannot fully ſatisfy our minds and reaſons about the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:60424:201"/>manner how it ſhall be done, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe bodies we ſhall riſe with, yet this ought not in the leaſt to ſhake or weaken our belief of this moſt important Article of our <hi>Chriſtian faith.</hi> Is it not ſufficient that an Almighty Being, with whom nothing is impoſſible, hath ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promiſed and paſt his word, that he will re-animate and re-enliven our mortal bodies, and after death raiſe us to life again? Let thoſe who preſume to mock at this glorious hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all good men, and are continually expoſing this doctrine, and raiſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it, firſt try their skill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ordinary and daily appearances of nature, which they have every day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes; let them rationally ſolve and explain every thing that happens in this world, of which themſelves are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, before they think to move us from the belief of the reſurrection by raiſing ſome duſt and difficulties about it, when Omnipotency it ſelf ſtands enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the performance of it. Can they tell me how their own bodies were framed and faſhioned, and curiouſly wrought? Can they give me a plain and ſatisfactory account by what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:60424:202"/>ſteps and degrets this glorious and ſtately ſtructure, conſiſting of ſo many ſeveral parts and members, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſo much delicate workmanſhip and rare contrivance, was at firſt erected? How was the firſt drop of bloud made, and how came the heart and veins and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to receive and contain it? of what, and by what means were the nerves and fibres made; what fixt thoſe little ſtrings in their due places and ſituations, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and adapted them for thoſe ſeveral uſes for which they ſerve? what diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht and ſeparated the brain from the other parts of the body, and placed it in the head, and filled it with animal ſpirits to move and animate the whole body? How came the body to be fenced with bones and ſinews, to be cloathed with skin and fleſh, diſtinguiſht into various muſcles? let them but anſwer me theſe and all the other queſtions I could put to them about the formation of their own body, and then I will willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſolve all the objections and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that they can raiſe concerning the reſurrection of it. But if they cannot give any account of the formation of that body they now live in, but are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:60424:202"/>to have recourſe to the infinite power and wiſedom of the firſt cauſe, the great and ſovereign orderer and diſpoſer of all things; let them know that the ſame power is able alſo to quicken and enliven it again after it is rotted and returned unto duſt: we muſt believe very few things, if this be a ſufficient reaſon for our doubting of any thing, that there are ſome things belonging to it which we cannot perfectly comprehend, or give a rational account of. In this ſtate our conceptions and reaſonings about the things that belong to the future and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world are very childiſh and vain; and we do but gueſs and talk at random, whenever we venture beyond what God hath revealed to us. Let us not therefore perplex and puzzle our ſelves with thoſe difficulties which have been raiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this doctrine of the reſurrection; for it is no abſurdity to ſuppoſe that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power may effect ſuch things as ſeem wholly impoſſible to ſuch finite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as we are; but rather let us hold faſt to what is plainly revealed concerning it, namely, that all thoſe who love and fear God ſhall be raiſed again after death the fame men they were before, and live for
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:60424:203"/>ever with God in unſpeakable happineſs both of body and ſoul.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to ſhew the poſſbility of a reſurrection in the ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſenſe; I now proceed to the ſecond thing I propounded, which was</p>
            <p n="2">II. (Since it is certain that the body we ſhall riſe with, though it may be as to ſubſtance the ſame with our terreſtrial body, yet will be ſo altered and changed in its modes and qualities, that it will be quite another kind of body from what it was before.) To give you a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the difference the Scripture makes between a glorified body and this mortal fleſh.</p>
            <p>But before I doe this, I ſhall premiſe this one thing; that all our conceptions of the future ſtate are yet very dark and imperfect. We are ſufficiently aſſured that we ſhall all after death be alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the very ſame men and perſons we were here; and that thoſe that have done good ſhall receive glory and honour and eternal life. But the nature of that joy and happineſs which is provided for
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:60424:203"/>us in the other world is not ſo plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; this we know, that it vaſtly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes all our imaginations, and that we are not able in this imperfect ſtate to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or conceive the greatneſs of it; we have not words big enough fully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it; or if it were deſcribed to us, our underſtandings are too ſhort and narrow to comprehend it. And therefore the Scriptures, from which alone we have all we know of a future ſtate, deſcribe it either firſt negatively, by propounding to us the ſeveral evils and inconveniences we ſhall then be totally freed from; or elſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by comparing the glory that ſhall then be revealed with thoſe things which men do moſt value and admire here: whence it is called an <hi>inheritance,</hi> a <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> a <hi>throne,</hi> a <hi>crown,</hi> a <hi>ſceptre,</hi> a <hi>rich treaſure,</hi> a <hi>river of pleaſures,</hi> a <hi>ſplendid robe,</hi> and an <hi>exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> All which do not ſignify to us the ſtrict nature of that happineſs which is promiſed us in another world, which doth not conſiſt in any outward ſenſible joys or pleaſures: But theſe being the beſt and greateſt things which this world can bleſs us with, which men do ordinarily moſt admire and value, and covet the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:60424:204"/>of, are made uſe of to ſet out to us the tranſcendent bleſſedneſs of another life, though indeed it is quite of another kind, and infinitely greater than the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt worldly happineſs. Theſe are onely little compariſons to help our weak ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and childiſh fancies; but we ſhall never truly and fully know the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the other world, till we come to enjoy them. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be:</hi> from the deſcription which the Scripture gives of the other world, as from a Map of an unknown Countrey; we may frame in our minds a rude confuſed idea and conception of it; and from thence, as <hi>Moſes</hi> from the top of Mount <hi>Piſgah,</hi> may take ſome little imperfect proſpect of the land of promiſe; but we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a complete notion of it, till we our ſelves are entred into it. However, ſo much of our future happineſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, as may be ſufficient to raiſe our thoughts and affections above the empty ſhadows and fading beauties, and flattering glories of this lower world: to make us ſenſible how mean and trifling our preſent joys and fatisfactions are, and to excite and engage our beſt and moſt hearty endeavours towards the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:60424:204"/>of it, whatever difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements we may meet with in this life; though all that can be ſaid, or we can poſſibly know of it, comes infinitely ſhort of what one day we ſhall feel and perceive, and be really poſſeſſed of.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed this, I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what change ſhall be wrought in our bodies at the reſurrection, which is no ſmall part of our future happineſs: now this change, according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Scriptures give of it, will conſiſt chiefly in theſe four things. 1. That our bodies ſhall be raiſed <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> and <hi>incorruptible;</hi> 2. that they ſhall be raiſed in <hi>glory;</hi> 3. that they ſhall be raiſed in <hi>power;</hi> 4. that they ſhall be raiſed <hi>ſpiritual bodies.</hi> All which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of our glorified bodies are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chapter, <hi>verſes</hi> 42, 43, 44. <hi>So alſo is the reſurrection of the dead. It is ſown in corruption, it is raiſed in incorruption; It is ſown in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, it is raiſed in glory; It is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power. It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body.</hi> And the explication of theſe words will give us the difference between the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:60424:205"/>body which we ſhall have in Heaven, and that mortal fleſh and vile earth which we are now burthened with.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The bodies which we ſhall have at the reſurrection will be immortal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible; verſe 53. <hi>For this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt put on incorruption, and this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal muſt put on immortality.</hi> Now theſe words <hi>immortal</hi> and <hi>incorruptible</hi> do not onely ſignify that we ſhall die no more, for in that ſenſe the bodies of the damned are alſo raiſed <hi>immortal</hi> and <hi>incorruptible,</hi> ſince they muſt live for ever, though it be in intolerable pain and miſery: but they denote farther a perfect freedom from all thoſe bodily evils which ſin hath brought into the world, and from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is penal, afflictive, or uneaſie to us; that our bodies ſhall not be ſubject to pain or diſeaſes, or thoſe other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences to which they are now daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious. This is called in Scripture the <hi>redemption of our bodies,</hi> the freeing them from all thoſe evils and maladies which they are here ſubject unto. Were we at the general reſurrection to receive the ſame bodies again, ſubject to thoſe frailties and miſeries which in this ſtate
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:60424:205"/>we are forced to wreſtle with, I much doubt whether a wiſe conſidering perſon, were it left to his choice, would willingly take it again; whether he would not chuſe to let it lie ſtill rotting in the grave, rather than conſent to be again fettered down and bound faſt to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſuch a cumberſome clod of earth: ſuch a reſurrection as this would indeed be what <hi>Plotinus</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a reſurrection to another ſleep:</hi> it would look more like a condemnation to death again, than a reſurrection to life.</p>
            <p>The beſt thing that we can ſay of this earthly houſe and tabernacle of clay, the tomb and ſepulchre of our ſouls, is, that it is a ruinous building, and it will not be long before it be diſſolved and tumble into duſt: that it is not our home, or reſting place, but that we look for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſe, <hi>not made with hands eternal in the heavens;</hi> that we ſhall not always be confined to this dolefull priſon, but that in a little time we ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſengaged and ſet free from this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of fleſh, ſhall be admitted <hi>into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</hi>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:60424:206"/>Alas! what frail and brittle things are theſe bodies of ours? How ſoon are they diſordered and diſcompoſed? To what a troop of diſeaſes, pains, and other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are they continually liable? And how doth the leaſt diſtemper or weakneſs diſturb and annoy our minds, interrupt our eaſe and reſt, and make life it ſelf a burthen to us? of how many ſeveral parts and members do our bodies conſiſt? and if any one of theſe be diſordered, the whole man ſuffers with it: If but one of thoſe ſlender veins or tender membranes, or little nerves and fibres, whereof our fleſh is made up, be either contracted or extended beyond its due proportion, or obſtructed, or corroded by any ſharp humour, or broken; what torment and anguiſh doth it create? How doth it pierce our ſouls with grief and pain? Nay when our bodies are at their beſt, what pains do we take, to what drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are we forced to ſubmit, to ſerve their neceſſities, to provide for their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance, and ſupply their wants; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their decays, to preſerve them in health, and to keep them tenantable, in ſome tolerable plight and fitneſs for the ſoul's uſe? We paſs away our days with
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:60424:206"/>labour and ſorrow in mean and ſervile employments, and are continually buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves about ſuch trifling matters, as are beneath a rational and immortal ſpirit to ſtoop to, or be ſolicitous about; And all this onely to ſupply our ſelves with food and raiment, and other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences for this mortal life, and to make proviſion for this vile contemptible fleſh, that it may want nothing that it craves or deſires. And what time we can ſpare from our labour, is taken up in reſting and refreſhing our tired and jaded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and giving them ſuch recruits as are neceſſary to fit them for work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and reſtore them to their former ſtrength and vigour. How are we forced every night to enter into the confines of death, even to ceaſe to be, at leaſt to paſs away ſo many hours without any uſefull or rational thoughts, onely to keep theſe carkaſſes in repair, and make them fit to undergo the drudgeries of the enfuing day? In a word, ſo long as theſe frail, weak and dying bodies, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſo many evils and inconvemences both from within and without, are ſo cloſely linkt and united to our ſouls, that not ſo much as any one part of them can
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:60424:207"/>ſuffer, but our ſouls muſt be affected with it; it is impoſſible that we ſhould enjoy much eaſe or reſt, or happineſs in this life, when it is in the power of ſo many thouſand contingencies to rob us of it. But our hope and comfort is, that the time will ſhortly come, when we ſhall be delivered from this burthen of fleſh: <hi>When God ſhall wipe away all tears from our eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying; neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things are paſſed away: When we ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more; neither ſhall the ſun light on us, nor any heat; for the lamb which is in the midſt of the throne ſhall feed us, and ſhall lead us into living fountains of waters.</hi> Oh when ſhall we arrive to thoſe happy regions, where no complaints were ever heard, where we ſhall all enjoy a conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted health and vigour both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mind, and never more be expoſed to pinching froſts or ſcorching heats, or any of thoſe inconveniences which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode this preſent pilgrimage? When we have once paſſed from death to life, we ſhall be perfectly eaſed of all that troubleſome care of our bodies, which
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:60424:207"/>now takes up ſo much of our time and thoughts: we ſhall be ſet free from all thoſe tireſome labours and ſervile drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which here we are forced to undergo for the maintenance and ſupport of our lives; and ſhall enjoy a perfect health, without being vexed with any nauſeous medicines, or tedious courſes of phyſick for the preſervation of it. Thoſe robes of light and glory which we ſhall be cloathed with at the reſurrection of the juſt, will not ſtand in need of thoſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proviſions, or crave thoſe ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which it is ſo grievous to us here either to procure or be without. <hi>But they,</hi> as our Saviour tells us, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. verſe 35, 36. <hi>which ſhall be accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to obtain that world, and the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage, neither can they die any more;</hi> for they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>equal to Angels:</hi> they ſhall live ſuch a life as the holy Angels do. Whence <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the body we ſhall have at the reſurrection <hi>carnem Angelificatam, Angelified fleſh,</hi> which ſhall neither be ſubject to thoſe weakneſſes and decays, nor want that daily ſuſtenance and continual recruit which theſe mortal bodies cannot ſubſiſt
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:60424:208"/>without. <hi>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and them.</hi> This is that perfect and complete happineſs which all good men ſhall enjoy in the other world; which, according to an Heathen Poet, may be thus briefly ſummed up. <hi>Mens ſana in corpore ſano, a mind free from all trouble and guilt in a body free from all pains and diſeaſes.</hi> Thus our mortal bodies ſhall be raiſed <hi>immortal;</hi> they ſhall not onely by the power of God be always preſerved from death, for ſo the bodies we have now, if God pleaſes, may become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; but the nature of them ſhall be ſo wholly changed and altered, that they ſhall not retain the ſame ſeeds or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of mortality and corruption; ſo that they who are once cloathed with them, as our Saviour tells us, <hi>cannot die any more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our bodies ſhall be raiſed in glory. <hi>Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of their Father,</hi> Matt. 13.43. Our heavenly bodies in brightneſs and glory ſhall contend with the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Sun it ſelf: A reſemblance of this we have in the luſtre of <hi>Moſes's
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:60424:208"/>face,</hi> which, after he had converſed with God in the Mount, did ſhine ſo gloriouſly, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were afraid to come near him, and therefore when he ſpake to them, he was forced to caſt a veil over his face to cloud and eclipſe the glory of it: And that extraordinary and miraculous majeſty of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſeems to be a preſage of that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory which our heavenly bodies ſhall be cloathed with: <hi>Acts</hi> 6.15. <hi>And all that ſate in the Council looking ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly on him, ſaw his face as it had been the face of an Angel.</hi> That is, they ſaw a great light and ſplendour about him; and if the bodies of Saints do ſometimes appear ſo glorious here on earth, how will they ſhine and glitter in the other world, when they ſhall be made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own glorious body? for ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>Chriſt will faſhion our vile bodies like unto his glorious body.</hi> Now how glorious and ſplendid the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, we may gheſs by the viſions of the two great Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former of them, when he ſaw the transfiguration of our Saviour, when <hi>his
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:60424:209"/>face did ſhine as the ſun, and his raiment became ſhining, and white as ſnow,</hi> was at the ſight of it ſo tranſported and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with joy and admiration, that he was in a manner beſides himſelf, for he knew not what he ſaid. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour diſcovered but a little of that glory which he now poſſeſſes, and will in due time communicate to his followers, yet that little of it made the place ſeem a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe: and the Diſciples were ſo taken with the ſight of it, that they thought they could wiſh for nothing better than always to live in ſuch pure light, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſo beautifull a ſight. <hi>It is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles:</hi> here let us fix and abide for ever. And if they thought this ſo great a happineſs, onely to be where ſuch heavenly bodies were preſent, and to behold them with their eyes, how much greater happineſs muſt they enjoy, who are admitted to dwell in ſuch glorious manſions, and are themſelves cloathed with ſo much bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſplendour?</p>
            <p>The other appearance of our bleſſed Saviour after his aſcenſion into Heaven to St. <hi>Paul</hi> as he was travelling to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:60424:209"/>was ſo glorious, that it put out his eyes; his ſenſes were not able to bear a light ſo refulgent: ſuch glorious creatures will our Lord make us all, if we continue his faithfull ſervants and followers; and we ſhall be ſo wonderfully changed, by the word of his power, from what we are in this vile ſtate, that the bodies we now have will not be able ſo much as to bear the ſight and preſence of thoſe bodies which ſhall be given us at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>Now this excellency of our heavenly bodies the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> fanſie will ariſe in a great meaſure from the happineſs of our ſouls. The unſpeakable joy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which our ſouls ſhall then enjoy, will break through our bodies, and be conſpicuous, and ſhine forth in the brightneſs of our countenances, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate them with beauty and ſplendour; as the joy of the ſoul, even in this life, hath ſome influence upon the body, and makes an imperfect impreſſion upon the countenance, by rendring it more ſerene and chearfull than otherwiſe it would be: as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.1. <hi>That a man's wiſedom maketh his face to ſhine.</hi>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:60424:210"/>Vertue and goodneſs purifies and exalts a man's natural temper, and makes his very looks more clear and brisk.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our bodies ſhall be <hi>raiſed in power.</hi> This is that which the <hi>Schools</hi> call the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our heavenly bodies, the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their motion, by which they ſhall be rendred moſt obedient and able inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſoul. In this ſtate our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are no better than clogs and fetters which confine and reſtrain the freedom of the ſoul, and hinder it is all her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>The corruptible body,</hi> as it is in the wiſedom of <hi>Solomon, preſſeth down the ſoul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that muſeth upon many things.</hi> Our dull, ſluggiſh and unactive bodies are often unable, oftner unready and backward to execute the orders, and obey the commands of our ſouls; ſo that they are rather hindrances to the ſoul, than any-ways uſefull or ſerviceable to her. But in the other life, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40.31. <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles; they ſhall run, and not be weary; and they ſhall walk, and not faint:</hi> or as
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60424:210"/>another expreſſes it; <hi>They ſhall ſhine, and run too and fro like ſparks amongſt the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> the ſpeed of their motion ſhall be like that of devouring fire in an heap of dry ſtubble, and the height of it ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the towring flight of the Eagle: for they ſhall <hi>meet the Lord in the air,</hi> when he comes to judgment, and afterwards mount up with him into the third and higheſt Heavens. This earthly body is continually groveling on the ground, ſlow and heavy in all its motions, liſtleſs, and ſoon tired with action; and the ſoul that dwells in it is forced, as it were, to drag and hale it along; but our heavenly bodies ſhall be as free, as active and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as our very thoughts are.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And Laſtly, Our bodies ſhall be <hi>raiſed ſpiritual bodies;</hi> not of a ſpiritual ſubſtance, for then the words would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a contradiction; it being impoſſible that the ſame thing ſhould be both a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and a bodily ſubſtance. But ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual is here oppoſed, not to corporeal, but to natural or animal; and by it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, (as it is ordinarily interpreted) the ſubtilty and tenuity and purity of our heavenly bodies. But I would rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:60424:211"/>it thus. In this ſtate our ſpirits are forced to ſerve our bodies, and to attend their leiſure, and do mightily depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in moſt of their operations; but on the contrary, in the other world our bodies ſhall wholly ſerve our ſpirits, and miniſter unto them, and depend upon them. So that by a natural body, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a body fitted for this lower and ſenſible world, for this earthly ſtate; by a ſpiritual body, ſuch an one as is ſuited and accommodated to a ſpiritual ſtate, to an inviſible world, to ſuch a life as the Saints and Angels lead in Heaven. And indeed this is the principal difference between this mortal body, and our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body. This <hi>fleſh,</hi> which now we are ſo apt to dote upon, is one of the greateſt and moſt dangerous enemies we have, and therefore is defied and renounced by all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their <hi>baptiſm,</hi> as well as the <hi>world</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> It continually tempts and ſolicits us to evil; every ſenſe is a ſnare to us, and all its luſts and appetites are inordinate and inſatiable; it is impatient of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s yoke, and refuſeth diſcipline; it is ungovernable, and often rebelleth againſt reaſon; and <hi>the law in our members warreth againſt the law of our
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:60424:211"/>minds, and brings us into captivity to the law of ſin which is in our members,</hi> and <hi>when the ſpirit is willing, the fleſh is weak;</hi> ſo that the beſt men are forced to keep it under, and uſe it hardly, leſt it ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them into folly and miſery. We are now in a ſtate of warfare, and muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be upon our guard and watch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually arming and defending our ſelves againſt the aſſaults of the fleſh, and all its violent and impetuous motions. How doth it hinder us in all our religious devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? How ſoon doth it jade our minds when employed in any divine or ſpiritual meditations; or how eaſily by its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching and enchanting pleaſure doth it divert them from ſuch noble exerciſes? So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> breaks forth into this ſad and mournfull complaint; <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Who ſhall? Death ſhall. That ſhall give us a full and final deliverance. When once we have obtained the reſurrection unto life, we ſhall not any more feel thoſe luſtings of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, which are here ſo troubleſome and uneaſie to us; our fleſh ſhall then ceaſe to vex our ſouls with its evil inclinations, immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:60424:212"/>and unreaſonable paſſions; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſelf ſpiritualized, purified, exalted and freed from this earthly groſneſs, and all manner of pollution, ſhall become a moſt fit and proper inſtrument of the ſoul in all her divine and heavenly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It ſhall not be weary of ſinging praiſes unto God Almighty through infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Ages. It ſhall want no reſpite or refreſhment, but its meat and drink ſhall be to doe the will of God.</p>
            <p>In theſe things chiefly conſiſts the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between thoſe bodies which we ſhall have at the reſurrection, and this mortal fleſh; which we can but very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly either conceive or expreſs: but yet from what hath been diſcourſed on this ſubject, it doth ſufficiently appear that a glorified body is infinitely more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and deſireable than that vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible fleſh which we now carry about with us. The onely thing remaining is,</p>
            <p n="3">III. And Laſtly, to draw ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inferences from all I have ſaid on this ſubject. I ſhall but juſt mention theſe five, and leave the improvement of them to your own private meditations.</p>
            <pb n="415" facs="tcp:60424:212"/>
            <p n="1">1. From what I have ſaid, we may learn the beſt way of fitting and preparing our ſelves to live in thoſe heavenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bodies which ſhall be beſtowed upon us at the reſurrection; which is by clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and purifying our ſouls ſtill more and more from all fleſhly filthineſs, and weaning our ſelves by degrees from this earthly body, and all ſenſual pleaſures and delights. We ſhould begin in this life to looſen and untie the knot between our ſouls and this mortal fleſh, to refine our affections, and raiſe them from things below, to things above; to take off our hearts, and leiſurely to diſengage them from things preſent and ſenſible, and to uſe and accuſtome our ſelves to think of, and converſe with things ſpiritual and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: that ſo our ſouls, when they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from this earthly body, may be prepared and diſpoſed to actuate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a pure and ſpiritual one, as having before hand taſted and reliſhed ſpiritual delights and pleaſures, and been in ſome degree acquainted with thoſe objects which ſhall then be preſented to us. A ſoul wholly immerſed and buried in this earthly body is not at all fit and qualified
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:60424:213"/>for thoſe celeſtial and glorious manſions which God hath provided for us: an earthly ſenſual mind is ſo much wedded to bodily pleaſures, as that it cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy its ſelf without them, and is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of taſting or reliſhing any other, though really greater, and infinitely to be preferred before them. Nay ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as mind onely the concerns of the body, and are wholly led by its motions and inclinations; as do, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as it were <hi>embody their ſouls,</hi> would eſteem it a great unhappineſs to be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a ſpiritual and heavenly body: it would be like cloathing a beggar in princely apparel. Such glorious bodies would be uneaſie to them; they would not know how to behave themſelves in them; they would e'en be glad to retire, and put on their rags again. But now by denying the ſolicitations of our fleſh, and contradicting its luſts and appetites, and weaning our ſelves from bodily pleaſures, and ſubduing and mortifying our carnal luſts, we fit and diſpoſe our ſelves for another ſtate: and when our ſouls are thus ſpiritualized, they will ſoon grow weary of this fleſh, and long for their departure; they will
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:60424:213"/>be always ready to take wing, and fly away into the other world, where at laſt they will meet with a body ſuited to their rational and ſpiritual appetites.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence we may give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the different degrees of glory in the other ſtate. For though all good men ſhall have glorious bodies, yet the glory of them all ſhall not be equal; they ſhall all ſhine as ſtars, and <hi>yet one ſtar differeth from another ſtar in glory; there is one glory of the ſun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the ſtars; ſo alſo is the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> Some will have bodies more bright and reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than others: Thoſe who have done ſome extraordinary ſervice to their Lord, who have ſuffered bravely and courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for his name; or thoſe who by the conſtant exerciſe of ſeverity and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation have arrived to an higher pitch, and attained to a greater meaſure of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holineſs than others, ſhall ſhine as ſtars of the firſt magnitude: <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>And they that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> It is certain that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:60424:214"/>and moſt ſpiritual bodies ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe who are moſt fitted for them, to the moſt heavenly and ſpiritual ſouls: ſo that this is no little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us to make the greateſt profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency we can poſſibly in the ways of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and piety, ſince the more we wean our ſelves from theſe preſent things and ſenſible objects, the more glorious and heavenly will our bodies be at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let this conſideration engage us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to bear thoſe afflictions, ſickneſſes and bodily pains which we are exerciſed with in this life. <hi>The time of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draweth nigh;</hi> let us but hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while longer, and all tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes, and we ſhall never ſigh nor ſorrow any more. And how ſoon ſhall we forget all the miſery and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we endured in this earthly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, when once we are cloathed with that houſe which is from above? we are now but in our journey towards the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> are pilgrims and ſtrangers here, and therefore muſt expect to ſtruggle with many ſtraits and difficulties, but it will not be long before we ſhall come to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:60424:214"/>our journeys end, and that will make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all: we ſhall then be in a quiet and ſafe harbour out of the reach of thoſe ſtorms and dangers wherewith we are here encompaſſed: we ſhall then be at home, at our Father's houſe, no more expoſed to thoſe inconveniences which, ſo long as we abide in this tabernacle of clay, we are ſubject unto. And let us not forfeit all this happineſs onely for want of a little more patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; but let us hold out to the end, and we ſhall at laſt receive abundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for all the trouble and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our paſſage, and be enſtated in perfect endleſs reſt and peace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let this eſpecially arm and fortify us againſt the fear of death; for death is now conquered and diſarmed, and can doe us no hurt. It ſeparates us indeed from this body for a while, but it is onely that we may receive it again far more pure and glorious. It takes away our old rags, and beſtows upon us royal robes: either therefore let us lay aſide the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this hope of the reſurrection unto life, or elſe let us with more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage expect our own diſſolution, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:60424:215"/>with greater patience bear that of our friends and relations. <hi>Wo is us who are forced ſtill to ſojourn in Meſech, and to dwell in the tents of Kedar:</hi> for how can it be well with us ſo long as we are chained to theſe earthly carcaſſes? As God therefore ſaid once to <hi>Jacob, fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will go down with thee, and I will ſurely bring thee up again;</hi> ſo may I ſay to you, fear not to go down into the houſe of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fear not to lay down your heads in the duſt, for God will certainly bring you out again, and that after a much more glorious manner. Let death pull down this houſe of clay, ſince God hath undertaken to rear it up again infinitely more ſplendid and uſefull.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, Let us all take care to live ſo here, that we may be <hi>accounted worthy to obtain the other world, and the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Let us <hi>riſe,</hi> in a moral ſenſe, <hi>from the death of ſin to the life of righteouſneſs,</hi> and then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death ſhall have no power over us. A renewed and purified mind and ſoul ſhall never fail of an heavenly and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body in the other world, but a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:60424:215"/>and worldly mind, as it hath no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for, ſo can it find no place in thoſe pure regions of light and happineſs. Since therefore we have this comfortable hope of a glorious reſurrection unto life eternal, let us <hi>purify our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit;</hi> let us hold faſt our profeſſion, and ſtedfaſtly adhere to our duty, whatever we may loſe or ſuffer by it here, as knowing <hi>we ſhall reap, if we faint not.</hi> And this is Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s exhortation with which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his diſcourſe of the reſurrection, <hi>Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words may be conſidered as the reſolution of a truly honeſt man, whoſe vertue and goodneſs depends not upon any outward accidents or fortuitous circumſtances; who in all
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:60424:217"/>things keeps an exact conſcience, and in all times, places and conditions acts by the ſame unalterable rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſteadily purſues what is good and honeſt, whatever he may loſe or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by it. Would you know, ſaith <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> whom I call a good and perfect man, I mean ſuch an one, <hi>quem malum facere nulla vis nulla neceſſitas poteſt.</hi> Whom no outward force, no exigence or turn of affairs, neither proſpect of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nor fear of inconvenience can ever prevail with to doe an evil or baſe action; who can never be ſwayed by any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſiniſter intereſt to doe that which his own mind inwardly diſapproves and condemns.</p>
            <p>A truly honeſt man conſiders not what will take beſt, or pleaſe moſt, whether it will prove for his credit or profit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall gain or loſe friends by it, whether it will hinder or further his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in the world; but in all caſes inviolably keeps to what is fit, juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and behaves himſelf as becomes a good honeſt man, being wholly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the ſucceſs and event of what his conſcience tells him he ought to doe:
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:60424:217"/>he is reſolved to pleaſe God, and to doe his duty, and to maintain the peace of his own mind, let the world go as it will.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, the crafty wiſe politicians of this world live by no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain law; profeſs, believe, practiſe this Religion, or that, or none at all, as may beſt ſuit with the preſent ſtate of things and juncture of affairs, or with thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular private deſigns which they carry on in the world, and in all their actions are governed by the giddy and uncertain meaſures of intereſt and worldly policy; and though ſometimes, if it happens to be for their intereſt ſo to doe, they may ſeem to ſpeak and act as fairly as any men whatever; yet to ſerve a turn, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their temporal ſafety and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or ſome other bye and ſelfiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, they ſhall not refuſe to commit the baſeſt and fouleſt crimes.</p>
            <p>Now that which I would perſuade you to from theſe words is this, that in all your actions you would govern your ſelves by the fixt and immutable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of conſcience and honeſty, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtedfaſtly adhere to your plain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:60424:218"/>though never ſo highly tempted to ſwerve from it. —<hi>Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me. My righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs I hold faſt and will not let it go, my heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live.</hi> I ſhall handle theſe words,</p>
            <p n="1">I. More particularly as they relate to <hi>Job,</hi> by whom they were ſpoken.</p>
            <p n="2">II. More generally, as they may be applied to men in all ſtates and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to the particular inſtance of <hi>Job,</hi> we all know he is propounded to us in holy Scripture as the moſt eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of an invincible reſolution and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken conſtancy in maintaining his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and integrity in two very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent fortunes, the one highly proſperous and flouriſhing, the other no leſs ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adverſe and calamitous; both which one after another by God's wiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did befall him, for the more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious trial and manifeſtation of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and diſintereſted loyalty to God and Religion; and it is no eaſie matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in which of theſe two ſtates he
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:60424:218"/>met with the greater temptations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he found it the more difficult task to keep a good conſcience in that ſplendid and plentifull condition he was once in, or to hold faſt his righteouſneſs in that deplorable poverty and want of all things, which he was at laſt reduced unto. For without doubt riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and high places, and an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted proſperity are as great ſnares, and as dangerous temptations, and often prove as fatal, nay, I may ſay, are generally more apt to draw men aſide from the love of goodneſs and the care of their ſouls, than the ſevereſt afflictions, or the moſt ſurprizing calamities and outward croſſes. So that <hi>Job</hi> perhaps was as much to be admired, and as hard to be imitated in his vertue and piety, when he was the greateſt man in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> as in his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, meekneſs and patience, when he became the miſerableſt ſpectacle that eyes ever beheld.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Job</hi> in his moſt proſperous ſtate <hi>held faſt his righteouſneſs, and would not let it go.</hi> Though he enjoyed all the pleaſures, riches and worldly ſatisfactions that the moſt ambitious or covetous mind could
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:60424:219"/>crave, yet he was ſo ſtrictly religious and temperate, that when he was deprived and ſtripp'd of all, and left as bare and as naked as he was when he firſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, his mind could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nor condemn him for any unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or unhandſome carriage, for any one notorious failure in his duty that ſhould provoke God to deal ſo harſhly with him. His three Friends indeed unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly fell into that fault which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt us even to this day, of judging and cenſuring men by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conditions, and by what befalls them in this life; they could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that ſuch unheard-of calamities could betide an innocent perſon; when therefore they ſaw ſo great a Lord and Prince in ſo forlorn a plight, him whom but a little before all men called bleſſed, and accounted the darling and favourite of Heaven, ſitting among the aſhes, and ſcraping his painfull boils with a piece of a broken pot, they preſently began to ſuſpect his piety and integrity, and to call upon him to confeſs thoſe grievous ſins which had plucked down ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vengeance upon his head, fondly preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he muſt needs be a greater ſinner
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:60424:219"/>than others, becauſe he was more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unfortunate. Which unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cenſure forced from this excellent perſon thoſe rhetorical and pathetical vindications of himſelf and all his actions in the days of his proſperity, which you may find ſcattered up and down in this Book, eſpecially in the 31ſt Chapter.</p>
            <p>Though his Friends were ſo unkind as to reproach and condemn him as guilty of ſome notorious crimes, whereby he had juſtly deſerved all thoſe evils which God had been pleaſed to lay upon him; yet his own conſcience, a more impartial judge, acquitted him, and ſpoke peace to him. He was not afraid or aſhamed to have all his life paſt impartially and thoroughly examined, and whatever he had done expoſed to publick view, and to the knowledge of all the world. Nay he durſt appeal to God himſelf, the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of hearts, and call the righteous and impartial judge of the earth to bear witneſs to his uprightneſs and ſincerity. He challenged even his very enemies, thoſe who had the leaſt kindneſs for him, to draw up a bill againſt him, and to try if they could find any thing whereof to
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:60424:220"/>accuſe him. He was ſo juſt, ſo humble, ſo moderate, ſo charitable, when he was in power and proſperity, that none ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther envied his greatneſs, or rejoyced at his fall. With ſuch prudence and ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with ſuch integrity and temper did he manage a great and magnificent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that in the loweſt ebb of it, when he was reduced to the meaneſt condition a man can poſſibly ſink into (and ſuch a change is moſt apt to open the mouths, not onely of our own conſciences, but of all that know us, againſt us;) I ſay, in this his worſt eſtate, neither his own mind, nor his friends, nor his enemies (if ſo good a man had any) could find matter of complaint or reproach againſt him. And this was ſuch a remarkable inſtance of pure and reſolute vertue, that God Almighty ſeemed to rejoice and triumph that he had now found a man who could preſerve himſelf innocent and upright even amidſt all the flattering temptations that attend riches and power and worldly greatneſs. <hi>Haſt thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> (ſaid the Lord unto Satan, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 8. as it were in a boaſting manner) <hi>my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:60424:220"/>man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evil?</hi> but</p>
            <p n="2">2. Behold the ſcene of a ſudden quite changed, and extreme poverty, loſs and pain dwelling there, where plenty and honour and riches formerly made their abode. The great enemy of mankind was at length ſatisfied that this renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſervant of God was not to be enticed by any of his baits; that he had a ſoul too great to fall in love with the fading beauties and periſhing glories of this world; and therefore when he ſaw he would not be moved from his duty by fair means, he uſes force and violence, and ſets himſelf openly to aſſault that vertue, which would not be caught in any of his ſnares, nor yield to any of his gilded temptations. And to this end in one day he ſpirits away all his wealth and ſervants, ſlays all his children by the fall of an houſe, and exerciſes ſuch cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon his body, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about him whole and entire and free from ſores, but onely <hi>the skin of his teeth;</hi> he arms his own wife and his beſt friends againſt him; his <hi>brethren went far from him; his acquaintance were
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:60424:221"/>eſtranged from him,</hi> his <hi>kinſmen failed him, and his familiars forgot him: the young children deſpiſed him, thoſe that dwelt in his houſe counted him for a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thoſe whom he loved moſt were turned againſt him.</hi> But when he was thus abandoned and forſaken of all, he yet held faſt his righteouſneſs, and would not remove his integrity from him; he ſtill preſerved a good conſcience, which neither the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> nor the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> nor the Devil himſelf could rob him of. Notwithſtanding all theſe violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taques of Satan, he bravely ſtood his ground, and the greatneſs of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings ſerved onely to make his courage and conſtancy ſtill more glorious and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious. Under all theſe afflictions he entertained not an unworthy thought, never uttered one hard word concerning God, but humbly kiſſed the hand that ſtruck him, and received evil things from him with the ſame gratefull reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he uſed to receive good things; and was as thankfull for theſe ſad misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and dire calamities, as other men are for the greateſt favours and bleſſings. And whatever betided him in this world, yet he would never fall out with God,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:60424:221"/>or doe any thing that might diſpleaſe him, or wound his own mind and conſcience. Thus this heavenly Champion came off with ſucceſs and victory, and <hi>the trial of his faith and patience</hi> was found <hi>unto praiſe and honour and glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the words thus underſtood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in particular to <hi>Job,</hi> as exerciſed with theſe various conflicts and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, afford us theſe two plain, but uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we ſhould ſo manage our ſelves in times of proſperity, and ſo uſe and improve our worldly advantages of health, riches, honour, authority, and the like, that whenever we come to be deprived of them, our <hi>hearts</hi> may have nothing to <hi>reproach</hi> us for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we ſhould never, either to prevent, or to redeem our ſelves from any outward evil and calamity, doe any thing which our own minds and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do diſapprove and condemn.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhould ſo manage our ſelves in times of proſperity, and ſo uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:60424:222"/>all worldly advantages of health, riches, honour, authority, and the like, that whenever we come to be deprived of them, our <hi>hearts</hi> may have nothing to <hi>reproach</hi> us for.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that ſo long as the world goes on our ſide, and we live in eaſe and plenty, and enjoy whatever our hearts can wiſh for, we have not ſo quick and lively a ſenſe of good and evil, nor do we ordinarily ſuffer our conſciences to ſpeak ſo freely and plainly to us, as when we are under ſome affliction or diſtreſs. Whilſt we enjoy an uninterrupted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, the noiſe and tumult of the world, the hurry and multiplicity of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and ſecular affairs, the variety of ſenſual pleaſures and delights, the mirth and jollity of company, and the ſeveral temporal projects and deſigns we have in hand do generally ſo wholly engroſs and prepoſſeſs our thoughts, as that they drown the ſofter whiſpers of our minds and reaſons, and allow no time or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to our conſciences to doe their office. But when once we meet with a ſudden check and ſtop, and are brought into ſtraits and difficulties, when we are
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:60424:222"/>croſſed and diſappointed, and all our fine hopes and expectations are blaſted and defeated, eſpecially when death and judgment draws nigh, then doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience take the advantage againſt us, and fly in our faces, and ſet our ſins in order before us, and fill our minds with galling regrets, and miſgiving fears, and diſquieting and uncomfortable reflexions upon our paſt follies, and we ſoon begin to have quite other notions and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of things than we had formerly in the days of ſunſhine and ſecurity. Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren, after they had ſold him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thereby had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted their Father's ſoul even unto death, for a long time ſeemed pleaſed and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with themſelves that they had done no worſe to their innocent brother, that they had not ſlain him; but afterwards when they found themſelves captives in a ſtrange Land, they laid their hands upon their breaſts and thought more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially on what they had done, <hi>and ſaid one to another, we are verily guilty concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our brother, in that we ſaw the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his ſoul when he beſought us, and we would not hear, therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="436" facs="tcp:60424:223"/>
            <p>When we come to languiſh upon a bed of ſickneſs, our minds will then take the liberty to reproach us for thoſe many days of health and ſtrength, which now without any ſenſe or remorſe we fondly trifle and ſquander away. Should our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches take to themſelves wings and flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (and we all know how ſlippery and uncertain all theſe earthly enjoyments are) it would then wound us ſore to think how much we ſtretched our conſciences to get ſome part of them, and how prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally we miſ-ſpent other part of them, how much we loved them and truſted in them, and what an ill uſe we made of them. If ever we our ſelves ſhould come to ſtand in need of the help, aſſiſtence and charity of others, how irkſome and uneaſie will it be to us, to remember how little our bowels were moved at the misfortunes of our poor neighbours, and what little compaſſion we ſhewed to the miſerable and neceſſitous, and how loth we were in our flouriſhing condition to doe any one a good turn, if it put us but to the leaſt expence or trouble?</p>
            <pb n="437" facs="tcp:60424:223"/>
            <p>However great and proſperous your preſent condition may be, yet often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it may ſhortly be otherwiſe with you, daily interpoſe the thoughts of a change: ſhould I loſe this honour, eſteem, authority and dignity I am now poſſeſſed of, how many untoward ſcars and blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes will ſtick upon me? ſhould I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a mean, low eſtate, ſhall I not then bluſh to be put in mind of that pride, vain-glory, haughtineſs, oppreſſion and domineering I was guilty of, when I was in place and power? and will not the forced remembrance of ſuch our baſe and unworthy behaviour be more grievous and afflictive to us, than any outward loſs or pain? our conſciences which now we ſtifle and ſmother, will at ſuch a time be even with us, <hi>and our own wickedneſs ſhall reprove us, and our iniquity ſhall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us,</hi> as the Prophet expreſſeth it.</p>
            <p>Learn therefore ſo to demean your ſelves in proſperity, as that your hearts may acquit you, and have nothing to chide and rebuke you for, when you come into adverſity; and ſo to husband and improve thoſe preſent advantages and
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60424:224"/>opportunities you have in your hands, that when they are withdrawn from you you may be able with great comfort and ſatisfaction to reflect upon the good you have done with them, the ſenſe of which will mightily blunt the edge, and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the ſharpneſs of thoſe evils that do at any time befall you; this was <hi>Job</hi>'s great comfort and ſupport under all his diſmal ſufferings, when he was fallen from the higheſt pinacle of wealth and honour almoſt as low as hell, that he had held faſt his integrity, and that his mind could not reproach him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhould never, either to prevent or to redeem our ſelves from any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evil or calamity, doe any thing which our own minds and conſciences do diſapprove and condemn. Though <hi>Job</hi> had loſt all other things that men u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually call good, yet <hi>his righteouſneſs he held faſt, and would not let it go:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the peace of our own minds is more to be valued than any temporal bleſſing whatever, and there is no pain or loſs ſo intolerable as that inward fear, regret and ſhame which ſin and guilt create: ſo that whatever external advantage we acquire
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:60424:224"/>in the world by wounding our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we are certainly great loſers by it; no real good can ever be obtained by doing ill, a guilty conſcience being the ſoreſt evil that a man can poſſibly be afflicted with.</p>
            <p>Herein eſpecially do inward troubles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all outward afflictions whatever that can happen to our bodies or eſtates; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that under all temporal calamities, how deſperate and remedileſs ſoever they be, yet we have ſomething to buoy up and ſupport our ſpirits, to keep us in heart, and ennable us to bear them, the joys of a good conſcience, the ſenſe or hopes of God's love and favour, the inward ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our own minds and thoughts, theſe things will wonderfully carry us through all thoſe difficulties and adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we ſhall meet with in the world, and are able to uphold and chear our hearts under the greateſt preſſures and hardſhips; but when a man's mind it ſelf is diſturbed and diſquieted, where ſhall he ſeek for, where can he find any eaſe or remedy?</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be the meaning of the Wiſe-man, in the 18th of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi>
               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:60424:225"/>the 14th Verſe, <hi>the ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmity, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> It is a ſaying much like that of our Saviours, <hi>if the ſalt hath loſt its favour wherewith ſhall it be ſalted?</hi> if that by which we ſeaſon all other things it ſelf want it, by what ſhall it be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned? ſo here <hi>the ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmity, i. e.</hi> a mind and ſpirit that is at peace within it ſelf, that is conſcious of its own innocence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity will enable a man to bear with great patience and contentment thoſe chaſtiſements which God may ſee good to exerciſe him with in this life; <hi>but a wounded ſpirit who can bear? i. e.</hi> if that ſpirit or mind which ſhould help us to bear all thoſe evils that betide us, be it ſelf wounded and diſquieted, what is there then left in a man to ſuſtain it? when our onely remedy is become our diſeaſe, when that which alone can ſupport us in all our troubles and diſtreſſes is become it ſelf our greateſt torment, how ſhall we be able to bear it?</p>
            <p>What dangers ſoever therefore we are expoſed unto, let us be ſure to preſerve a good conſcience, nay let us rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:60424:225"/>the greateſt evils, than doe the leaſt. If we always continue faithfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the dictates of reaſon and religion, our minds will be in peace, and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our having pleaſed God and done our duty, and ſecured our greateſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt will hugely eaſe and alleviate our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and ſuſtain us under the moſt preſſing evils we can ſuffer in this life, whereas on the other ſide, the greateſt confluence of the good things of this world will not be able to free us from the diſturbance and anxiety of an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or to quiet and ſettle our minds when haraſſed and tortured with the ſenſe of guilt: And this ſhall lead me to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing I propounded, which was,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider theſe words more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, as they may be applied to men in all ſtates and conditions, and then they propound to us this rule, which we ſhould always live by; namely, that we ſhould upon no conſideration whatever doe any thing that our minds or conſciences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us for. And this is the juſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an honeſt man, and of one fit to be truſted, that he will never either out of fear or favour conſent to doe any
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60424:226"/>thing that his mind tells him is unfit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, or unbecoming, or that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer or juſtify to himſelf; but in all caſes will doe what is right and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, however it may be thought of and reliſhed by other men; and reſolutely adhere to his plain duty, though perhaps it may hinder his preferment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, his trade and gain, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to many inconveniences in this world. I wiſh you would all with <hi>Job</hi> in my Text take up this brave reſolution, <hi>My righteouſneſs I will hold faſt, and will not let it go; my heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live.</hi> For your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement I ſhall onely crave leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto you theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this is the plaineſt, eaſieſt, and moſt certain rule that we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is the wiſeſt and ſafeſt rule, the beſt policy, all things conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this is the plaineſt, eaſieſt, and moſt certain rule that we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our ſelves. Let times be never ſo difficult or dangerous, and affairs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:60424:226"/>ſo intricate and involved, yet an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man is hardly ever at a loſs what to doe; <hi>The integrity of the upright ſhall guide him, and the righteouſneſs of the perfect ſhall direct his way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The path of juſtice and honeſty is ſtreight, right on, neither to the right hand, nor to the left; there are no laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths or winding Meanders in it, ſo that there is no great wit or cunning required to find it out. To any one whoſe mind is free from prejudice and evil affections, who is not governed by blind paſſion or intereſt, or any bye corrupt deſigns, the way he ſhould walk in is plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, like the high-way. So it is called by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah: An high-way ſhall be there, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs, and wayfaring men, though fools, ſhall not err therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for thoſe indeed that will not keep the direct road, but thinking to paſs ſome nearer way, travel in untrodden paths, through deſart woods or ſolitary fields, over hedge and ditch, as we ſay, it is no wonder if they are ſometimes out of their way, and go backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60424:227"/>and are often at a ſtand, not knowing how to guide their ſteps, and what path to chuſe, till at laſt they are utterly loſt and bewildred; and ſuch are all the wiſe men of this world, who make haſte to be rich, and are reſolved by right or wrong to be great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and mind nothing but their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and worldly advantage; who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the plain and beaten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enin of vertue and piety, and betake themſelves to the crooked ways of unrighteouſneſs; they are infinitely various and uncertain, ſometimes they go ſtreight forward, and then quite back again; ſometimes they are of one party, ſometimes of another; to day of this Religion, to morrow of that, reeling to and fro like a drunken man; ſo that whatever they profeſs themſelves to be this week, yet neither themſelves, nor any one elſe can gueſs what mind they will be of the next, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their opinions and judgments and practices depend upon ſuch cauſes as are as variable as the wind or weather: they are always ready to turn as the tide and ſtream does, and are reſolved to pleaſe thoſe that are uppermoſt, like the <hi>Roman</hi> that told <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> in his Civil-wars,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:60424:227"/>when asked by him what ſide he would take, that he would be <hi>praeda vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris,</hi> of that party which prevailed.</p>
            <p>But alas! what an abſurd and unequal life do ſuch men lead? How do their minds, their words, their actions claſh and interfere one with the other? How often are they forced to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to call themſelves fools or knaves for doing thoſe things, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when another intereſt is to be ſerved, they are fain to diſown, nay to doe the quite contrary? Into what mazes and perplexities doth this wandring, fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle and deſultory temper betray men? what pitifull ſhifts are they put to to patch up ſuch diſagreeing practices, and to reconcile ſuch different deſigns? ſince they are forced ſervilely to comply with ſo many ſeveral humours, to act ſo many different parts, and ſo often to follow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counſels, and take new meaſures; with what great artifice and ſubtilty muſt they continually manage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with what warineſs muſt they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their feet, leſt by any miſadventure they ſhould expoſe their own mean and ſordid deſigns?</p>
            <pb n="446" facs="tcp:60424:228"/>
            <p>Now ſuch perſons as are thus fickle and inconſtant to themſelves, and are guided by no fixt and ſteady principles, but onely by their own preſent intereſt, which depends upon the uncertain ſtate of worldly affairs, and a thouſand other little contingencies, muſt needs be often at a loſs which way to ſteer themſelves, and can never be certain they are in the right. They are always to ſeek, and are utterly unreſolved what to ſay or doe, till they can ſmell out how matters are likely to go, and ſee the final event and iſſue of things: ſuch men are like the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritanes,</hi> who, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were in any affliction or danger, diſclaimed all acquaintance with them, and relation to them, and knew them not; but at another time, when the <hi>Jews</hi> proſpered, and were great and potent, then they boaſted of their alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and would needs be near a-kin to them, of the race of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> the Sons of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, he that aims at nothing more than to pleaſe God and his own conſcience, and to doe the duty of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:60424:228"/>the place he is in fairly and juſtly, in all times knows what to doe, and is ſtill the ſame man, <hi>and meddles not with thoſe that are given to change;</hi> his own honeſty is his tutour and directour, his counſellour and guide. He knows that the nature of goodneſs and vertue is always the ſame, and cannot be altered by any change of the times or ſtate of affairs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under all external changes and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences whatever, he keeps the ſame ſmooth and even courſe of righteouſneſs, peaceableneſs, ſobriety, loyalty and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; whether the world ſmiles or frowns upon him, he ſtill holds to his principles, does the ſame things, and goes on in the ſame road; and nothing, neither <hi>honour</hi> nor <hi>diſhonour,</hi> neither <hi>good report</hi> nor <hi>evil report</hi> can divert him from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is not onely the plaineſt, but the wiſeſt and ſafeſt rule, the beſt policy, all things conſidered. For if we reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely maintain our innocence and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhall ordinarily eſcape beſt in this life; but however</p>
            <pb n="448" facs="tcp:60424:229"/>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhall be ſure to come off well at laſt, and to be plentifully rewarded for our faithfulneſs and uprightneſs in the other world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhall ordinarily eſcape beſt in this life. There is nothing that doth more contribute to our ſafety and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity even in the worſt and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times, than a firm and conſtant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to our duty. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By this we engage God Almighty to be our friend, and do moſt effectually recommend our ſelves to his care and good providence; ſo long as we commit our ways unto God in well-doing, and no hazards or dangers on the one ſide, nor any worldly advantages or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences on the other can prevail with us in any one inſtance to diſobey him, we may be aſſured that he will never forſake us, but that he will either deliver us from thoſe evils we fear, or elſe ſupport us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and by the aſſiſtences of his bleſſed ſpirit enable us to bear them with patience and chearfulneſs. A good man in all his dangers and diſtreſſes hath a ſure
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:60424:229"/>friend, who will always ſtand by him; an Almighty Saviour and Deliverer, on whom he may ſecurely rely for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and protection; he is not <hi>afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord:</hi> He hath nothing to agaſt him, or fill him with pale fears, and dreadfull terrours and jealouſies; he hath no ſecret guilt that haunts him and ſtares him in the face, and ſeverely threatens him; and therefore amidſt all worldly diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and confuſions, he is not diſmayed; his innocence doth inſpirit him with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and courage, he is not afraid to truſt God with his life and honour, and eſtate, or any thing elſe that is dear to him; and can with an humble confidence and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as it were, challenge the favour of Heaven, ſaying with good <hi>Hezekiah, Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight: though the earth ſhould be removed, and the mountains carried into the midſt of the Sea; though the waters thereof ſhould roar and be troubled, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſhake</hi> and tremble <hi>with the ſwelling thereof;</hi> nay, though the world ſhould
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:60424:230"/>crack and break in pieces about his ears, yet <hi>intrepidum ferient ruinae,</hi> he would ſtill be unmoved and unſhaken. Knowing that his father, his friend, his patron and benefactour, whom he hath always ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the honeſty and ſimplicity of his heart, is Pilot of the Ship, in all the ſtorms and tempeſts of this lower world he can put his truſt in God, and with an unſhaken confidence commit himſelf, and all he hath, to him, who is engaged to protect and defend the innocent, who encourage and ſupport themſelves in him alone. The Lord is his <hi>ſtrength,</hi> his <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,</hi> his <hi>refuge in the day of affliction,</hi> and under the <hi>ſhadow of his wings,</hi> as in an impregnable caſtle, he can ſecurely hide and ſhelter himſelf, <hi>till theſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be overpaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now on the other ſide the worldly projectour, who will not truſt himſelf or his concerns with Almighty wiſedom and power, but endeavours to ſecure himſelf, and to raiſe his fortunes, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf great and conſiderable in the world by ways of his own deviſing, ſuch as God doth not allow, nay doth ſtrictly forbid; who, as it were, renounces God
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:60424:230"/>Almighty's care and protection, and places all his hope and confidence in his own craft and ſagacity, hath nothing to ſupport and bear up his ſpirit under any misfortunes. In a time of publick dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and calamity he is the moſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate forſaken wretch in the world: his guilt arms every thing againſt him, and makes him afraid even of his own ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, (like that wicked Emperour <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> who every time it thundred ran under his bed, as if he had been aimed at in every crack;) at ſuch a time he is at his wits end, and knows not where to turn himſelf, and his <hi>hope is as a ſpider's web,</hi> nay <hi>as the giving up of the ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) An honeſt and upright man is moſt likely to find the beſt treatment from other men, even from the moſt wicked and ungodly. <hi>Who is he that will harm you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> 1 Pet. 3.13. a good man is armed with innocence and harmleſneſs, which will guard and defend him from the injuries of wicked and lawleſs men: his unaffected piety, and unbyaſſed honeſty, and undiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled charity, the excellency of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:60424:231"/>and diſpoſition, and the unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of his life and converſation will ſpeak in his behalf, and plead his cauſe, and procure him ſo much love and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in the world, that there will be but few that can find the heart to doe him any miſchief; as the harmleſs inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ſimplicity of little children do ſecure and protect them from all harm and violence, and engage every one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in their defence. Whence this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation hath been made, and is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by experience, that one who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and wavering is loved by no man, becauſe he is not fit to be truſted; but a man who is conſtant to worthy and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous principles commands the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of eſteem and veneration from all men, and is commonly ſafe and ſecure in all times, his very enemies reverencing ſuch invincible vertue and honeſty. He that deſires and deſigns nothing but what is fair and reaſonable, may promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the good-will of all round about him: whereas he that is deeply engaged in worldly intrigues, and is reſolved, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> to enrich himſelf, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways climing higher, trampling upon all that ſtand in his way, muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:60424:231"/>be engaged in many quarrels, and make many enemies, and draw on himſelf the envy and ill-will of the proud and ambitious, and live in perpetual emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contention; for as he ſtriveth to exceed and overtop others, ſo others endeavour as much to get before him; and though for a-while he getteth the better, yet his enemies are at work to undermine him, and blow him up, and he muſt expect that in a little time ſome ſudden change of affairs, ſome unlucky hit or other will tumble him down, and put an end to all his fine deſigns and projects.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Whatever misfortunes and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments an honeſt upright man may meet with in the world, yet he incurs no real diſgrace, <hi>he ſhall not be aſhamed in an evil day:</hi> no man can reproach him, or juſtly inſult over his fall. Whereas when the deſigns of ambitious and covetous oppreſſours are fruſtrated and defeated, when the crafty Politicians of this world are enſnared in their own devices, <hi>the city rejoiceth,</hi> it is matter of ſport and triumph to their neighbours, and every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the juſtice of it. But I haſten.</p>
            <pb n="454" facs="tcp:60424:232"/>
            <p n="4">(4.) An upright man, how miſerable and forlorn ſoever his outward condition be, yet is pleaſed and ſatisfied with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; his mind is at quiet, and though the weather abroad be never ſo bluſtering and tempeſtuous, yet there is a calm within, and he is then moſt ſenſible of the joy and contentment which flows from inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and a rightly ordered converſation, when there is the moſt trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion without him. When all the plagues of God are poured upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> a good man is a <hi>Goſhen</hi> to himſelf, hath light in darkneſs, and under the moſt cloudy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Heavens, finds nothing but clearneſs and ſerenity in his own breaſt; and a good conſcience can make a man rich and great and happy even in the midſt of the greateſt worldly miſeries and diſtractions.</p>
            <p>Whereas when wicked men are in any danger or diſtreſs, they have a ſecret enemy in their own boſoms, and their guilty conſciences will fly in their faces, and fill them with amazing fears and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and wrack and torture their ſouls with unexpreſſible grief and anguiſh. And
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:60424:232"/>oh! how ſad and diſconſolate muſt their condition needs be, when the arrows of the Almighty ſtick faſt in them, and the poiſon thereof drinks up their ſpirits, and the terrours of God ſet themſelves in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray againſt them; when there is nothing but diſmaying dangers and diſtractions abroad, and all outward hopes fail them, and at the ſame time their own minds write bitter things againſt them? this will double every evil that befalls them, the ſenſe of guilt being the very ſting and venom of all outward troubles and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that exactly obſerves the rules and dictates of his own conſcience will be ſure to come off well at laſt, in the final account and judgment; then God will confirm and ratify the ſentence of his conſcience, and publickly own and approve of what he hath done, and clear and vindicate his innocency, and reward his fidelity and conſtancy before all the world.</p>
            <p>At that day, when all our great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers and contrivers of miſchief, all the cunning practiſers of guile and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:60424:233"/>ſhall lie down in ſhame, when their ſecret arts and baſe tricks, whereby they impoſed on the world, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and <hi>proclaimed,</hi> as it were, <hi>upon the houſe-top,</hi> and all their unworthy projects and deſigns ſhall be laid open and naked, being ſtript of thoſe ſpecious pretences they here diſguiſed them with; when the hidden things of darkneſs ſhall be brought to light, and the counſels of all mens hearts ſhall be made manifeſt as the noon-day; at that day, I ſay, the upright and righteous man ſhall ſtand in great boldneſs, and ſhall lift up his head with joy and confidence; and then it will appear that he was the beſt politician, and the onely perſon that either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood or regarded his true intereſt.</p>
            <p>To conclude all. Our conſciences are either our beſt friends, or our greateſt enemies; they are either a continual feaſt, or a very hell to us. A conſcience well reſolved and ſetled, is the greateſt comfort of our lives, the beſt antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all kind of temptations, the moſt pretious treaſure that we can lay up againſt an evil day, and our ſureſt and ſtrongeſt hold to ſecure us from all dangers, which
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:60424:233"/>can never be taken unleſs through our own folly and negligence.</p>
            <p>But an evil clamorous conſcience that is continually twitting and reproaching us, is a perpetual wrack and torment; it waſts our ſpirits, and preys upon our hearts, and eats out the ſweetneſs of all our worldly enjoyments, and fills us with horrid fears and ghaſtly apprehenſions; this is that knawing <hi>worm that never dieth,</hi> the neceſſary fruit of ſin and guilt, and the neceſſary cauſe of everlaſting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and vexation.</p>

               <hi>LIFE and immortality</hi> by a figure often uſed in the holy Scriptures is the ſame with immortal life, which our Saviour <hi>hath brought to light,</hi> that is, hath given us undoubted aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of, by the revelation of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="460" facs="tcp:60424:235"/>
            <p>For though all men by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have ſome apprehenſions of a future ſtate, yet their reaſonings about it, when left to themſelves are miſerably vain and uncertain, and often very wild and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant. The beſt diſcourſes of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> about the other life were weak and obſcure, and the wiſeſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſpake but doubtfully and conjecturally about it; nor even in the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> are there contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any plain expreſs promiſes of eternal life; all the knowledge men had of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was but like the faint glimmerings of twilight, till the ſun of righteouſneſs appeared; till God was pleaſed to ſend one from that inviſible world, even his own moſt dear Son to dwell here and converſe amongſt men, to make a full diſcovery to us of this unknown coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to conduct us in the onely true way to this everlaſting happineſs; an happineſs ſo great that we have not words big enough to expreſs it, nor faculties large enough to comprehend it: but yet ſo much of it is clearly revealed to us in the Goſpel as is moſt abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to raiſe our thoughts and incite our
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:60424:235"/>ſincereſt endeavours for the obtaining of it.</p>
            <p>By which plain revelation of this ſtate of immortality,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Is moſt illuſtriouſly manifeſted to us the tranſcendent goodneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of our moſt mercifull Creatour, in that he will be pleaſed to reward ſuch imperfect ſervices, ſuch mean performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as the beſt of ours are with glory ſo immenſe, <hi>as that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive</hi> the greatneſs of it. There is nothing in us, nor any thing done by us that bears the leaſt proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch an ample recompence. Our beſt actions ſtand in need of a pardon, ſo far are they from deſerving to be crowned. All poſſible duty and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we certainly owe to him, to whom we owe our beings, and ſhould God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty have exacted it from us onely on the account of his ſovereign authority over us as we are his creatures we had been indiſpenſably obliged to all ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; but that he ſhould over and above promiſe to reward our faithfulneſs
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:60424:236"/>to him with eternal life, this is a moſt wonderfull inſtance of his infinite grace and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By this revelation of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life is farther demonſtrated the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great love of our ever bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who by his death and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not onely purchaſed pardon for all our paſt rebellions and tranſgreſſions, not onely redeemed us from hell and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which we had all rendred our ſelves moſt juſtly liable, (which alone had been an unſpeakable favour) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo merited an everlaſting kingdom of glory for us, if with true repentance we return to our duty. And this if any thing ſhews the infinite value and efficacy of our Saviour's appearing on our behalf, that by his moſt powerfull mediation he obtained not onely freedom from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo unexpreſſibly glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for us vile and wretched ſinners up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eaſie and moſt reaſonable conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This eſpecially recommends our Chriſtianity to us, which contains ſuch glad tidings, which propounds ſuch mighty arguments to engage us to our
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:60424:236"/>duty, ſuch as no other religion ever did or could. For ſince hope and fear are the great hinges of all government, and the moſt prevailing paſſions of humane nature, what better thing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to our hope than to be as happy both in body and ſoul as we can be, and that for ever? what more dreadfull thing to our fear than everlaſting miſery? and this indeed is the utmoſt that can be ſaid or offered to men in order to the reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them from their ſins, and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to a conſcientious obſervance of God's laws, that God hath appointed a day wherein he will call all men to an account for the deeds they have done in this body, and reward the ſincere, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtian with immortal glory, and puniſh the diſobedient and impenitent with everlaſting vengeance, and if men can harden themſelves againſt theſe moſt powerfull conſiderations, if they are not at all concerned or ſolicitous about their eternal happineſs or miſery, what other motives are likely to prevail with them, or able to make any impreſſion upon them? For is there any thing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight and moment that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the reaſons and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:60424:237"/>of men than what ſhall become of them in a ſtate which they are very ſhortly to enter upon, and which ſhall never have an end?</p>
            <p>I humbly therefore beg your patience whilſt with all the plainneſs and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I can, I apply my ſelf to theſe three ſorts of perſons.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To thoſe who would ſeem to doubt of this fundamental doctrine of a future life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To thoſe who profeſs to believe it, but not fully and heartily.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To thoſe who do really and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly believe it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I begin with thoſe who would ſeem to doubt of this fundamental doctrine of a future life. And though far better things are to be hoped concerning all here preſent, who ſhew ſo much reſpect to religion, as to bear a part in God's ſolemn worſhip, yet ſince nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of than the prevailing atheiſm of this age; and ſince, if we judge of mens
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:60424:237"/>faith by their lives, we cannot but ſuſpect many of thoſe who paſs among us for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox believers to be really no other than mere infidels in theſe matters: I ſhall not wholly paſs theſe ſort of perſons by: not that I deſign at large to ſhew you the unreaſonableneſs of atheiſm, or to ſet before you the undeniable eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have of another world; but I ſhall put the whole cauſe upon this ſhort iſſue.</p>
            <p>Let us for once be ſo kind to the <hi>ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> diſputers againſt religion as to ſuppoſe what they are never able to prove, that it is a very doubtfull thing whether there will be another life after this; that it is poſſible that all theſe ſtories of a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, heaven and hell, are mere fables, the inventions of crafty <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians</hi> and deſigning <hi>Prieſts;</hi> and that all good and vertuous men have been miſerably deceived and fed with fond hopes and fancies, and have unneceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled themſelves about the matters of religion: (and ſurely you will all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be a very large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion) yet granting all this, nothing is more plain than that if we would act prudently, and conſult our own ſafety
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:60424:238"/>we ought to believe and live as if all theſe doctrines of religion were moſt certainly true; for every wiſe man will run as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hazard as he can, eſpecially in ſuch things as are of higheſt concernment to him, and wherein a miſtake would be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and undoing. Here therefore be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">(I.) What little hazard he runs, or what little loſs he ordinarily undergoes who believes and acts according to theſe principles, ſhould they all at laſt prove falſe.</p>
            <p n="2">(II.) What extreme and deſperate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard he runs, who doth not believe, nor live according to them, ſhould they all at laſt prove true.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What little hazard he runs, or what little loſs he ordinarily undergoes who believes and acts according to theſe principles ſhould they all at laſt prove falſe. All that this man loſes or ventures is onely ſome preſent gratifications, and enjoyments which he denies himſelf; he croſſes indeed the irregular inclinations of his nature, and forbears thoſe exceſſes
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:60424:238"/>that are truly hurtfull to him, and lives according to the dignity of his ſpecies, and is poſſeſſed with cares and fears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout another world, (and theſe even the atheiſt himſelf cannot wholly free his mind from) and ties up himſelf to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rules and ſtrict duties, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not a little to his convenient living here, and perhaps is expoſed to ſome hardſhips, reproaches and ſufferings for righteouſneſs ſake; and this is the worſt of his caſe: but on the other ſide, he is bleſſed at preſent with a contented life, with peace of conſcience, and the joyfull expectation of an eternal reward hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that if he be in the right, he is then made for ever; if not, if he be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, his condition however will be no worſe than other mortals; he will have loſt indeed all the pains and trouble he was at about religion, but if his ſoul ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive not his body, he will never be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it; this diſappointment will never vex nor grieve him in that land where all things are forgotten. So that a vertuous and righteous man may ordinarily paſs his days here more eaſily and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly than any wicked perſon, and pleaſe himſelf all his life long with the hopes or
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:60424:239"/>dreams of future glories; which fancy alone (were it no other) will make him abundant recompence for all the ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial it puts him upon. But if theſe things at laſt prove true, he is then bleſſed above all expreſſion; if they prove falſe and vain hopes, and there be no other life after this, yet will it be as well with <hi>him</hi> as with the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in that ſuppoſed ſtate of eternal ſilence and inſenſibility. He runs no hazard, he loſes nothing except ſome forbidden pleaſures, which in moſt caſes it is beſt for him, even as to this life, to be without. He is ſafe if theſe doctrines be not true, and unſpeakably happy for ever if they be true.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Conſider the extreme and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hazard that man runs who doth not believe nor act according to theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſhould they at laſt prove true; for he ſtakes and pawns all that can be called good and deſirable; he ventures being for ever undone and miſerable, if he ſhould chance to be miſtaken in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and it ſhould at laſt prove that there is another life after this. And therefore nothing would ſooner convince ſuch men of their deadly folly, than if
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:60424:239"/>they would but ſometimes ask themſelves when they are calm and ſober a few ſuch queſtions as theſe: What though I have almoſt perſuaded my ſelf that religion is nothing but a melancholy dream, or a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick cheat, or a common errour; yet what if at laſt it ſhould be true? How diſmal, and of what affrighting conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is a miſtake in ſuch a matter as this? what amazing, ſurprizing thoughts, fears and deſpairs will it fill me with, if after all I ſhould find my ſelf to be alive when my friends had cloſed my eyes, and ſhould preſently be hurried away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the company of thoſe ſpirits, which I had before derided and droll'd upon, and into the preſence of that God whoſe exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence I had boldly denied? What hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and confuſion muſt it create, when my infidelity ſhall be confuted by ſuch a wofull experiment, and I ſhall find my ſelf ſuddenly entred into that endleſs ſtate which I would not here believe any thing of?</p>
            <p>Were the arguments on both ſides e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, yet the hazards are infinitely une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, ſince the one runs the chance of being for ever happy, the other runs the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:60424:240"/>chance of being eternally miſerable. Which one conſideration juſtifies the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of a religious man in renouncing and deſpiſing the glories and pleaſures of this world, though it were very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether there were another life after this. How much greater madneſs then muſt they needs be guilty of, who reject this doctrine of another life, againſt all the probabilities, reaſons, nay, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the truth of it? when they have as great evidence of the truth of it as its nature will admit of; when God from Heaven hath moſt plainly revealed it to them; when this revelation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by all the ſigns and teſtimonies they can reaſonably expect and demand; nay, when he hath implanted in their ſouls ſuch a lively apprehenſion of it, as that they muſt offer the greateſt force and violence to their own minds before they can bring themſelves to disbelieve it? nay, I believe, let the moſt reſolved ſinner labour and ſtruggle never ſo hard with himſelf to ſubdue and extirpate this natural perſuaſion of another life, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his pains he will not be able whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to root out all thoughts and fears of it. This ſhall ſuffice for the firſt ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:60424:240"/>thoſe who doubt of, or deny this great fundamental of Religion. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To thoſe who profeſs to believe this immortal life, but yet doe it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and heartily. And this I fear is the caſe of the generality of Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. For it may well be enquired, what is the reaſon that this promiſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, (than which there cannot be a greater) hath yet ſo little power upon mens minds, doth ſo little move their affections? what makes their endeavours after it ſo faint and languid? Are any of thoſe good things which men here court and ſeek after ſo deſirable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as the glories and joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? or are there any evils in this world that can vie terrours with Hell? this cannot be pretended ſince all the good or evil things of this world can onely make us happy or miſerable for a ſhort time, for this life at moſt, which is not to be named with living for ever either in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable happineſs or miſery. Whence is it then that Chriſtians are ſo ſtrangely cold and indifferent about theſe moſt weighty things of another life, as if they
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:60424:241"/>were of no concernment to them? After all our ſearch we muſt reſolve it into one of theſe two cauſes.</p>
            <p>Either that men, whatever they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, do not heartily believe this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or elſe that they do not duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Moſt men, whatever they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs or pretend, though they dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce or deny it, yet are not heartily and thoroughly perſuaded of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this future ſtate. Their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings were never rationally convinced of the truth of it, and ſo the belief of it is not firmly rooted and ſetled in their minds.</p>
            <p>Would but God Almighty be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly pleaſed to indulge to us a ſight of thoſe future glories and miſeries which he hath revealed in the Goſpel, this we imagine would certainly prevail for the conviction and reformation of all men. Would he give us, though but a ſhort and tranſient view of that bleſſed place where himſelf dwells, that we might but for a few moments behold the joys and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:60424:241"/>triumphs of thoſe happy ſouls that are admitted into his beatifick preſence; or would he but open the gates of Hell, and once ſuffer us to look into thoſe diſmal receptacles of impure ſpirits, that ſo we might be eye and ear witneſſes of their grievous torments and horrid deſpair, ſuch a ſight as this we doubt not would preſently change us all, and make us whatever God requires us to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But God's ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts.</hi> He governs men in a method ſuited to their reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble natures, and hath given us ſuch aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of another life, as are abundantly ſufficient to ſatisfy and convince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of men, but yet may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by thoſe who have no mind, or are reſolved not to believe it. For there could have been no trial of men, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination made between the wiſe and conſidering, and the fooliſh and wicked, if the rewards of Religion had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or expoſed to our ſenſes. God will not force a faith upon us, as the ſight of theſe things would do, but will have it to be a matter of choice, and an inſtance of vertue in us. No praiſe is due to them
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:60424:242"/>who believe onely what they ſee. Such cannot be ſaid to believe God, but their own eyes: but rather <hi>bleſſed are they,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>who have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi> God hath denied us the ſight of theſe things to prove us, and try whether we dare truſt his promiſes and threatnings. Our belief therefore of this inviſible world, if we would have it effectual for the amendment of our hearts and lives, muſt be ſo ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as to ſerve inſtead of ocular and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible demonſtration. (Whence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.11. <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi>) that ſo the <hi>things unſeen</hi> which God hath revealed to us, may have the ſame effect upon us, (not as to degree, but the ſame real effect) as if the other world were always viſible to us.</p>
            <p>Now our belief of any thing muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſtronger or weaker according as the evidence is upon which it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and that not onely as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in it ſelf, but as it is perceived by us. For however evident a thing may be in it ſelf, yet if it doth not appear ſo to us, our belief of it muſt be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and wavering, becauſe it is
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:60424:242"/>groundleſs. Since then the truths or principles of Religion, which relate to another life, are not things to be ſeen or felt, we can be aſſured of them onely by undeniable arguments and teſtimonies; about which we muſt uſe our reaſons, and our diſcerning and judging faculties before we can underſtand the force of them, or be really convinced by them. Not that there is any great difficulty in apprehending theſe arguments; but yet there is required ſuch attention of mind and ſerious thoughts about them, and a frequent revolving over the proofs and evidences of a future ſtate with ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and carefull examination of them, as all men ordinarily uſe about other matters, wherein they are greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to find out the truth.</p>
            <p>But now is any thing more plain, than that the generality of Chriſtians, who profeſs theſe Doctrines of Religion, are ſo far from being rationally by the force of arguments convinced of the truth of them, that very few amongſt them ever ſo much as ſet themſelves to enquire into the reaſons of their belief? They owe their faith ſolely to education, prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:60424:243"/>inſtruction and example of others, take it up without any conſideration of the grounds and reaſons of it: and is it then at all wonderfull that this faith ſhould have but very little force or power on mens minds, which is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without any rational conviction of their underſtandings, which is thus weakly founded and ſupported? Any little blaſt will overthrow that houſe which is thus built upon the ſands.</p>
            <p>I deny not but that a belief thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up upon truſt, and confirmed by a long and cuſtomary profeſſion of it, may be ſo ſtrong, and a man may be ſo reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it, as that he will never ſtir from it. But then, I ſay, this is not the faith which our Saviour requires, or which God will accept of in thoſe who are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a better; and a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> born and bred at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> hath as good reaſon for his belief of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as ſuch a one hath for the belief of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Such a faith is onely an obſtinacy in adhering to thoſe things which we were firſt taught, whether true or falſe, and is common to men in all Religions.</p>
            <pb n="477" facs="tcp:60424:243"/>
            <p>Our underſtanding is the imperial and governing faculty of our ſouls. It is that which doth engage our wills and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo conſequently by them move and excite us to action. When therefore our underſtanding doth aſſent to any truth upon clear and ſatisfactory evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, being overpowred by the force of reaſon and argument, it muſt needs propound it with greater ſtrength and authority to the lower faculties, and ſo muſt have more powerfull influence upon all our affections and actions. Otherwiſe how can we expect but that any little reaſon ſhould be too hard for, and baffle that faith, which is grounded on no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all? or how can we think that thoſe things which we believe, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſufficient convincing motive or evidence, ſhould outweigh thoſe things which we are more certain of, which we daily ſee, feel and experience, ſuch as are the preſent ſenſible pleaſures, and the viſible good and evil things of this life? This therefore is one great reaſon of the inefficacy of mens faith, that their belief of theſe great truths was never well rooted and fixed in their underſtandings.</p>
            <pb n="478" facs="tcp:60424:244"/>
            <p n="2">(2.) If our underſtandings are ſo fully convinced of theſe truths, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any longer doubt of them, and yet this belief is not effectual for our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the reaſon then muſt be onely becauſe we do not really conſider them. The underſtanding hath not ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power over the will, as neceſſarily to determine it always to that which it judges beſt and fitteſt; but after our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings have yielded, our wills may ſtubbornly hold out againſt the ſiege and batteries of the cleareſt evidence, and ſtrongeſt reaſons, if the truths propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded be contrary to our fleſhly luſts, and worldly intereſts.</p>
            <p>For the will of man is a kind of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle faculty between the underſtanding and the bodily inclinations; and as it is moved by our underſtanding to follow and obey its dictates, ſo alſo it is moſt importunately ſolicited by our lower fleſhly appetites and luſts, craving their ſeveral ſatisfactions and gratifications, and by outward objects that continually thruſt themſelves upon us agreeable to thoſe deſires and propenſities. Hence
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:60424:244"/>ariſeth a great conflict between thoſe truths of Religion which are propounded by our underſtandings on the one ſide, and our inferiour ſenſitive faculties on the other. Our luſts being checked and croſſed by the hopes and fears of another life, make the ſhrewdeſt objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the principles of Religion, and do with all their force and power oppoſe the entertainment of them in our minds, and on the ſucceſs of this conteſt doth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally depend the efficacy of our faith.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with very many amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> whilſt our bleſſed Saviour was alive here upon earth. They could not reſiſt thoſe undoubted teſtimonies which he gave of his being the Son of God; but yet the love of this world, or fear of ſufferings had ſo much greater power over their wills, as that they could never prevail with themſelves to become his Diſciples. St. <hi>John</hi> 12.42, 43. <hi>Among the chief rulers many believed on him, but becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue. For they loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="480" facs="tcp:60424:245"/>
            <p>It is not enough therefore that theſe truths of Religion have ſubdued our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by the evidence of reaſon, but they muſt alſo conquer our will, and draw out its affections after them, before ever they can have any laſting effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our lives. For the affections of the will are the moſt immediate principles of all our actions, and therefore till our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief hath powerfully wrought upon theſe affections of love, deſire, hope, fear, it can have little or no influence upon our outward actions.</p>
            <p>Now the way and means to obtain this conſent of our wills and affections to theſe truths thus propounded by our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, is often and moſt ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the immenſe greatneſs of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs offered to us; the extremity of the miſery threatned; how vaſtly it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us what our portion ſhall be in that eternal ſtate; how unſpeakably ſad and unpitied our condition will be, if we fooliſhly neglect providing for it; how infinitely the glory of Heaven doth ſurpaſs all the joys and pleaſures of this life. Theſe things, and the like, in a
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:60424:245"/>lively manner repreſented unto, and fixed in our minds, will by degrees ſo captivate our wills and affections, as that we cannot but love and chuſe this future happineſs as our greateſt good; fear and fly from this eternal miſery as the greateſt evil that can poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide us.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch infinite moment are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of eternity, that if we do but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently attend to them, and exerciſe our thoughts freely about them; if we will not ſuffer our luſt to bribe and byaſs our judgments or to ſtifle and choak theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion; they will at laſt awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our conſciences, and prevail above all preſent temptations. And when our faith, by the frequent and ſerious conſideration of the mighty importance of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and of their conſequence to us, hath made ſuch a complete conqueſt over our minds and wills, then our actions will of themſelves naturally follow. For men will live and act agreably to what they love, deſire, hope for, or fear moſt.</p>
            <p>So effectually hath our Chriſtianity provided for the happineſs of all men,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:60424:246"/>that nothing can make us miſerable, but either not believing, or not conſidering the great arguments of Religion.</p>
            <p>The different behaviour of men as to the promiſes of our Saviour concerning another life, I ſhall beg leave to illuſtrate by this plain ſimilitude.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a perſon of great credit and authority ſhould now appear amongſt us, and ſhould propound to us, that if we would follow him, entirely reſigning up our ſelves to be governed by him, he would ſafely conduct us all to a certain Countrey or Iſland, where we ſhould poſſeſs all that our hearts could wiſh, ſhould be all Kings and Princes, and flow in all manner of wealth, and enjoy an uninterrupted health; in a word, want nothing that men can fanſie could contribute any way to their complete ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and contentment: and farther, that he ſhould give all the ſecurity that any reaſonable man could expect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that this was no vain promiſe or il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. Now ſome amongſt us will give no heed at all to what this man offers, nor be convinced by any reaſons or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:60424:246"/>he can give them; but being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudiced againſt his perſon, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking the conditions, ſtreight reject him for a Deceiver and Impoſtour. Theſe are the Atheiſts and unbelievers.</p>
            <p>Others are indeed convinced that all this is likely to be true, they cannot ſee any ſufficient cauſe to doubt of it; but yet they enjoy ſuch conveniences, and are ſo taken with their preſent circumſtances here, as that they will not quit them for theſe hopes. Theſe are the fond lovers of this world.</p>
            <p>Others are willing to go to this place, but they think it time enough yet. They would tarry and live here where they are, as long as they can; and when they can ſtay no longer here, then they would be glad to be wafted to this fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſland. Theſe are they that defer their repentance till a death-bed.</p>
            <p>Others acknowledge that there is ſuch a place, where a man may live as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily as this perſon deſcribes, but they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he doth not ſhew the right way to it. They would find out a nearer and
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:60424:247"/>ſhorter cut to this Countrey. Theſe are Hereticks and Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>Others are reſolved to venture with him, and begin the journey; but mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with ſome difficulties and dangers in the paſſage, they are ſoon diſcouraged and frighted, and return home. <hi>Theſe are they who receive the word</hi> of God <hi>gladly, but when tribulation and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſe, by and by they are offended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, a few amongſt us wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon this Perſon's promiſes, and preferring them before all preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and enjoyments, forſake all their concerns and relations here, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely give up themſelves to his guidance. And when in the paſſage they meet with any dangers or hardſhips, croſs winds or ſtorms; though this may make them ſtagger a little, and fill them with doubts and fears; yet they are reſolved ſtill to go on, and venture all upon it. Theſe, and theſe onely, are the true believers.</p>
            <p>There are many degrees of faith, but the leaſt degree of ſaving faith is, when the conſideration of another world is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:60424:247"/>our moſt prevailing intereſt, and is the main principle that gives law and rule to all our converſation. Let none then think to be ſaved by ſuch a faith as the very Devils in Hell have, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Devils ſtill. They believe theſe great truths of Chriſtianity as really and as much as thou doſt, who onely aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to them in thy underſtanding, and confeſſeſt them with thy mouth, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt and contradicteſt them in thy life and practice.</p>
            <p>To pretend to believe this great doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of another life which ſhall never end, and not to govern our ſelves by this perſuaſion, is the moſt unaccountable and prodigious folly that a reaſonable creature can be guilty of; according to that famous ſaying of a great man in this caſe, That <hi>the ſtrangeſt monſter in nature was a ſpeculative Atheiſt,</hi> one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the being of a God and a future ſtate, <hi>excepting one, and that was the practical Atheiſt</hi> who profeſſed to believe both, but lived as if he was certain there were neither.</p>
            <pb n="486" facs="tcp:60424:248"/>
            <p>Nor indeed is the difference between them great. The one, <hi>the Atheiſt,</hi> winks hard, and ſo ruſhes blindfold upon eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine. The other, <hi>the wicked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> runs madly upon it with both his eyes wide open. How inexcuſable muſt they be at the laſt day; what plea can they offer for themſelves, who obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſed that happineſs, which yet they acknowledged to be infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that this world could bleſs its moſt darling favourites with? who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully precipitated themſelves into thoſe evils and miſeries which they had a plain foreſight of.</p>
            <p>I conclude this head with that anſwer which a defender of <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is ſaid once to have given to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his, who freely indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſame vitious courſe of life the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> did; but yet took upon him to wonder how one that denied the being of a God, and of a future life, could quiet his mind in ſuch a deſperate eſtate. <hi>Nay rather,</hi> ſays the <hi>Atheiſt, it is much more ſtrange how you can quiet your mind, or ſleep contentedly in ſuch a vitious courſe of
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:60424:248"/>life as I ſee you lead, whilſt you believe ſuch things as you ſay you do.</hi> And ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one would think that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for ſuch a man to live in peace, without laying aſide either his faith or his ſins. Now the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> chuſes to lay aſide his faith, that he may ſin more quietly; the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> lays aſide his ſins, that they may not defeat his hopes: and which of theſe two acts more wiſely, if we will not ſee in this our day, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal event and iſſue of things will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly convince us to our everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and confuſion. Thus much for thoſe who do profeſs to believe another life, but do it not really and heartily.</p>
            <p n="3">III. All that remains is to apply my ſelf in a few words to thoſe who do heartily and conſtantly believe this great truth of another life after this; who not onely aſſent to this doctrine with their underſtandings, but have made this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs their ultimate choice and deſire. And to them I need not ſay much; for this faith alone will always teach them what to doe, without the help of an inſtructour. It will e'en force them to doe well, without a guide or monitour.</p>
            <pb n="488" facs="tcp:60424:249"/>
            <p>This will fortify our minds againſt all the temptations we may meet with from this world, or any of its bewitching en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. So that that man who hath his eternal ſtate always in his eye, is ſet above the power of this world's frowns or ſmiles. He can neither be tempted by the ſufferings of this life, nor yet enticed by any of its alluring charms. Can he, whoſe thoughts are fixed upon thrones and kingdoms, and immortal glory, be diverted by the gay baubles, or glittering toys which this world preſents him with? It offers him infinitely too little. When the ſoul once by faith is mounted beyond the ſtars into that place where God and his Saviour dwells, how mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, how vile and ſordid do all things here below appear? when this whole earth ſeems but a point, how next to nothing is that ſmall pittance of it which any one man can poſſeſs or enjoy? Faith looks beyond this preſent ſcene of things; beholds this world diſſolv'd, and all the glory and pomp of it vaniſhing; and this curtain being drawn, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to his view a new world, wherein are joys and pleaſures and honours ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:60424:249"/>and eternal; the proſpect and fore-thought of which, rectifies his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about theſe inferiour things, and begets very ſlight and undervaluing thoughts of all things on this ſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>This faith will inſpire us with ſtrength and activity, and carry us out even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our ſelves; will animate us with ſuch courage and reſolution, as that we ſhall deſpiſe all dangers and difficulties, and think eternal happineſs a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whatever pains or trouble it may coſt us to purchaſe it. Such great hopes ſet before us, will animate us with an undaunted bravery and courage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to work wonders.</p>
            <p>This conquers the love of life it ſelf, which is moſt deeply implanted in our natures; for what will not a man give or part with for the ſaving of his life? Yet they who have been endued with this faith, have <hi>not counted their lives dear to them, ſo that they might finiſh their courſe with joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="490" facs="tcp:60424:250"/>
            <p>I have not time now to ſet before you the trophies and victories which this faith hath atchieved; you may find many of them recorded in the famous 11th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where the Apoſtle for the encouragement of all true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, propounds to us the brave exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> of old, <hi>who through faith ſubdued king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, wrought righteouſneſs, out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were made ſtrong, were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a better reſurrection, had trial of cruel mockings and ſcourgings, yea moreover of bonds and impriſonments: they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were ſlain with the ſword, wandred about in ſheep-skins and goat-skins, afflicted, deſtitute and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Theſe and many more like theſe were the exploits of the Saints under the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> who had not ſo clear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of this eternal ſtate, as we now have under the Goſpel. But far greater yet, and more ſtupendious are the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of faith in the holy lives and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient deaths of the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and primitive <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſours,</hi> who with invincible conſtancy endured pains
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:60424:250"/>and torments to fleſh and bloud inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, onely aſſiſted and upheld by the grace of God, and a lively faith in this promiſe of his ſon <hi>Jeſus.</hi> They clap'd their hands, and ſang praiſes in the midſt of ſcorching ſlames, they <hi>took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods,</hi> and gave God thanks <hi>that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for his name:</hi> and without doubt God's grace and the ſame lively faith would produce in us the very ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and enable us to doe and to ſuffer the ſame things with the ſame joy and reſolution.</p>
            <p>But farther, This faith by degrees moulds and transforms the mind into a likeneſs to theſe heavenly objects, it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and raiſes our ſpirits, ſo that they become truly great and noble, and makes us, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>partakers of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It filleth the ſoul with conſtant peace and ſatisfaction, ſo that in all conditions of life, a good man can feaſt himſelf with unſeen joys and delights, which the worldly man neither knows, nor can reliſh. This makes him content with
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:60424:251"/>any ſmall allowance of this worlds goods and glad if by any hard ſhift he can rub through this world till he comes to his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>He is but very little concerned about theſe ſeemingly grand affairs of this life, which ſo much take up and buſie other mens thoughts and time. He converſeth moſt with inviſible objects, and with them finds that ſolid and laſting comfort, which all outward things can neither give nor take away.</p>
            <p>He hath ſomething to uphold and chear his ſpirit under all worldly calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſtractions; and when he is wearied with the impertinencies of this life, or is not pleaſed with things here below; he can retire himſelf into the other world, and there entertain his mind with thoſe raviſhing joys that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cloy nor ſatiate.</p>
            <p>Nay, this faith arms a man againſt the fear of death; it ſtrips that <hi>King of terrours</hi> of all his grim looks; for he conſiders it onely as God's meſſenger to knock off his fetters, to free him from
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:60424:251"/>this fleſhly priſon, and to conduct him to that bleſſed place, where he ſhall be more happy than he can wiſh or deſire to be, and that for ever.</p>
            <p>All this and much more than I can now ſpeak, will this faith do, where it is ſincere and hearty. It will ſerve us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſight; it will afford us a fore-taſt of this immortal happineſs; it will give us preſent entrance into heaven in part, and at laſt a full and complete fruition of it.</p>
            <p>Oh then let it be moſt plainly ſeen by our words, by our works, by all we doe, whereever we are, what our faith and hope is. Let it appear to all men that <hi>we walk by faith, not by ſight</hi> or ſenſe. Senſe is a mean, low, narrow principle, confin'd to this preſent time, and this lower earth; it can reach no higher than theſe outward viſible things, nor can it look farther than things preſent. But <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> they ſteer their courſe and govern their lives, not by what they ſee, but by what they believe and hope for, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king beyond things temporal for thoſe things that are eternal.</p>
            <pb n="494" facs="tcp:60424:252"/>
            <p>Let us not be aſhamed of this our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and aim-before all men, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others think or ſay of us for it, we are reſolved to be happy, not onely for a few days or years, but for ever; that we will ſo uſe this world as thoſe that muſt ſhortly leave it; that we will ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and husband our time, as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that it will ſoon be no more, but be ſwallowed up in eternity: and did the ſtupid world know and believe what you doe, they would no longer wonder at your being ſo much moved in a caſe of ſuch unſpeakable and everlaſting conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God who hath ſet ſuch mighty hopes before us, who hath given us ſuch glorious promiſes, who hath made ſuch a plain and clear revelation of this eternal life by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and hath by him taught us the true way of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it; who himſelf became to us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that holy life he preſcribed to us, and after he had ſuffered for our tranſgreſſions in our nature, entred into the higheſt heavens to prepare manſions of glory for all the faithfull followers of
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:60424:252"/>him. To whom therefore with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> one eternal God, be aſcribed by us and all men, all praiſe, thankſgiving and obedience for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
